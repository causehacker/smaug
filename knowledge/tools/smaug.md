A tool that automatically archives Twitter/X bookmarks to markdown files. Like a dragon hoarding treasure, Smaug collects valuable bookmarked content and organizes it into a personal knowledge system. It fetches bookmarks via the bird CLI, expands shortened URLs, extracts content from linked pages (GitHub repos, articles, quote tweets), and uses Claude Code to analyze and categorize each bookmark. Bookmarks are saved to markdown organized by date with rich context, and can be filed into a knowledge library structure.
