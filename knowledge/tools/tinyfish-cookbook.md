A collection of sample apps and recipes built with the TinyFish web agent. TinyFish is a web agents API that lets you treat real websites like programmable surfaces, turning any website into an API using natural language goals and returning structured JSON.

## Key Features

- **Any website as an API** — Turn ordinary websites (including ones without official APIs) into programmable surfaces
- **Natural language to structured JSON** — Send a URL plus a natural language goal, get back clean JSON
- **Real browser automation** — Navigate real websites in real time, handling complex flows like multi-step bookings, forms, filters, calendars, and dynamic JavaScript content
- **Built-in Stealth** — Every request runs in a stealth browser profile with rotating proxies to reduce anti-bot detection
- **Production-grade Logs** — Detailed observability for debugging and monitoring
- **Flexible Integration** — Use as HTTP API, visual Playground, or MCP server inside tools like Claude and Cursor
