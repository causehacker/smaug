Qwen3-Coder-Next is an open-weight language model specifically designed for coding agents and local development. Built on Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Base with hybrid attention and MoE architecture, it achieves strong performance on agentic coding tasks while maintaining significantly lower inference costs (80B total params, 3B active).

## Key Features

- **Strong agentic coding performance**: Achieves results comparable to Claude Sonnet on SWE-Bench Pro
- **Efficient architecture**: 80B total parameters with only 3B active, optimizing the efficiency-performance tradeoff
- **Platform compatibility**: Supports OpenClaw, Qwen Code, Claude Code, Cline, web development, and browser use
- **Long context support**: Native 256K token context length, extendable to 1M tokens using Yarn
- **Agentic training at scale**: Trained on 800K+ verifiable tasks with executable environments
- **Multi-language support**: Supports 358 coding languages
- **Specialized function call format**: Designed for integration with coding agents
