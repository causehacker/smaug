A monorepo for creating product launch videos using Remotion, Next.js, and TailwindCSS. Built by the Cua team for creating product videos with React instead of traditional video editors. Works great with Claude Code and Remotion skills - they used this to make the Cua-Bench video in 2 hours.

## Key Features

- Pre-built video templates for product launches
- Shared animation components (FadeIn, SlideUp, TextReveal)
- Example project (cuabench) showing word-by-word text animations, terminal scenes, and counters
- Integrated with Claude Code + Remotion skills for AI-assisted video development
- TypeScript-based with 107 stars
