Moltworker is a middleware Worker and adapted scripts that allows running Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot) on Cloudflare's Sandbox SDK and Developer Platform APIs. This enables self-hosting of an AI personal assistant without requiring any new hardware like Mac Minis.

## Key Features

- Runs on Cloudflare Workers at the edge
- Uses Cloudflare's Sandbox SDK for containerized execution
- Leverages Cloudflare Developer Platform APIs
- Self-hosted AI agent without dedicated hardware requirements
- Based on Moltbot (previously known as Clawdbot)

## What Makes It Interesting

This project demonstrates how edge computing platforms can run sophisticated AI agents without requiring users to purchase and maintain dedicated hardware. By leveraging Cloudflare's serverless infrastructure, developers can deploy personal AI assistants that scale automatically and run close to users globally.
