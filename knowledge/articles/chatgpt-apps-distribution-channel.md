Lenny Rachitsky highlights ChatGPT apps as a major new distribution opportunity, comparable to the App Store in 2008 or early SEO. With 800 million potential users and a low barrier to entry, developers can build apps in 30 minutes that integrate with ChatGPT's discovery system. The article covers how users discover apps (ChatGPT suggests based on intent), technical implementation details (tools, MCP, message flow), and provides step-by-step guides using Replit or Chippy with copy-paste prompts and technical deep-dives.

## Key Takeaways
