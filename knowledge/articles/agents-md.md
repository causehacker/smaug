AGENTS.md is a simple, open format for guiding AI coding agents, used by over 60,000 open-source projects. It serves as a "README for agents" - a dedicated, predictable place to provide context and instructions to help AI coding agents work on your project effectively.

## Key Takeaways

- Provides a standardized way to give coding agents project-specific context
- Already adopted by 60k+ open-source projects on GitHub
- Helps agents understand project structure, conventions, and requirements
- Similar concept to README but specifically designed for AI agent consumption
- Part of the growing ecosystem of tools and formats for AI-assisted development

## Context

This was shared in the context of a discussion about advanced development workflows using multiple AI models (GPT 5.2 Codex CLI, Opus 4.5, Gemini 3.0 Pro) via MCP servers, highlighting how AGENTS.md fits into sophisticated multi-agent development pipelines.
