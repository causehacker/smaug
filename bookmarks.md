## @anothercohen - AI Workflow Transformation with OpenClaw
> It's pretty incredible how much of how I work has changed in just the last two weeks.
>
> We rolled out an AI chatbot inside Slack (OpenClaw), hooked up a bunch of tools via MCP and APIs, and now I basically just chat with AI to knock out entire projects. I can also do a lot more work when I'm on the go and only have access to my phone.
>
> As I finish each project, I turn it into a reusable skill so the rest of the team can use it. Anyone can also update the AI's SOUL file to set overarching rules for how it operates. The system just keeps getting more useful.
>
> Example from yesterday: I created a skill where anyone on the sales team can message the bot after a sales call. The AI finds the relevant Granola meeting notes and HubSpot deal, asks a few clarifying questions, then generates a full ROI analysis spreadsheet and a custom pitch deck and shares the xlsx and pptx files right inside Slack.
>
> If something's not right, we just tell the AI what to fix and it goes off and spawns sub agents and figures out how to make the changes.
>
> Pretty insane

## @justin_hart - AI Strategic Ideation Engine Prompt

> Try this prompt with your AI OpenClaw bot today (or like I did, overnight!)

> ———————
>
> ROLE:
> You are an autonomous strategic ideation engine embedded inside a live knowledge repository.
>
> You are not here to summarize.
> You are not here to optimize.
> You are here to DISCOVER leverage.
>
> OBJECTIVE:
> Perform a full-spectrum structural excavation of the entire repository — including hidden markdown files, system-level instruction files (https://t.co/j0oRTo5Vgs, https://t.co/xIahErwQWI, https://t.co/beARKEsFMp), nested directories, logs, creative outputs, dashboards, unused experiments, archived drafts, data exports, CSVs, and any latent structural artifacts.
>
> Then generate 10 radically original launchable ideas.
>
> These ideas:
> • Must NOT be incremental improvements.
> • Must NOT be simple optimizations of existing work.
> • Must NOT be obvious extensions of current domains.
> • May be unrelated to current projects.
> • May introduce entirely new intellectual territories.
> • Should feel surprising, asymmetric, and "where did that come from?"
> • Must be implementable within 30 days with focused effort.
>
> Each idea should feel like:
> — A new instrument.
> — A new category.
> — A new lens.
> — A new tool.
> — Or a new kind of cultural artifact.
>
> If it feels safe, predictable, or adjacent — discard it.

## @WasimShips - Build a Better Indie App by Fixing Top Competitor Complaints

> The easiest path to a viral indie app right now (that actually makes money):
>
> Go to https://t.co/DaxZKlTMRX → Top Gainers (last 30 days)

> *Quoting @mpeltz:* Your AI conversations aren't privileged. Yesterday, Judge Jed Rakoff ruled that 31 documents a defendant generated using an AI tool and later shared with his defense attorneys are not protected by attorney-client privilege or work product doctrine.

> The logic is simple: an AI tool is not an attorney. It has no law license, owes no duty of loyalty, and its terms of service explicitly disclaim any attorney-client relationship.

i spent the last 24 hours generating over 200 seedance 2.0 videos to figure out the best prompting framework system for AI UGC

this video was made with 1 prompt and 1 tool, no editing was done to the video this was just a prompt to a video

this is by far the best model i've ever used

and the craziest part is that it can be fully automated

this is the first time we can actually automate high quality ai ugc at this level

bytedance owns tiktok so this model is trained on millions of high quality ugc videos.

you just need to know how to extract that and call it in your prompt.

## @MoonDevOnYT - Polymarket API Bots for Automated Trading
> Print USDC While You Sleep: The Step-by-Step Guide to Polymarket API Bots
>
> most people are busy gambling on sportsbooks but the real wealth is being built in the prediction markets where code handles the odds while you sleep. there is a specific bridge between being a retail trader and becoming a market maker that most people never cross because they think they need a finance degree
>
> i believe that code is the great equalizer because i used to be the guy getting liquidated and over trading until i decided to learn to code. i spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on developers for apps in the past because i thought i was not smart enough to code myself but now fully automated systems trade for me instead of getting me wiped out
>
> prediction markets like polymarket are not like a casino where you bet against the house but an exchange where you trade against other users. this means the prices you see are actually probabilities where an eighteen cent share represents an eighteen percent chance of an event happening
>
> if you think the odds are better than the market suggests you buy the shares and wait for the outcome. the real secret to profiting in this space is not picking the winner of the next election but being the one who provides the liquidity for everyone else to trade
>
> the secret of the liquidity provider is that they earn money from the spread plus the rewards the platform pays out. most traders think they have to have a crystal ball but we just need a python script that can sit on the bid and the ask simultaneously
>
> there is a hidden danger in how these exchanges report data that can lead to your bot placing the wrong orders. i spent hours digging into the documentation to find the logic that keeps everything in sync so you do not have to repeat my mistakes
>
> when we talk about the central limit order book we are looking at a unified system where a yes buy is essentially a no sell. once you understand that yes plus no always equals one dollar you realize that the market is always in a state of balance that can be exploited
>
> there is a blockchain backdoor for balances that allows us to bypass the exchange api entirely when things get laggy. i discovered that we can use the web3 library in python to talk directly to the polygon rpc and see our usdc balance in real time
>
> by looking directly at the smart contracts we can ensure that our bot always knows exactly how much capital it has to work with. this prevents the common error of trying to place an order with funds that are already locked in another trade
>
> there is a specific logic buried in the code of top traders that allows them to make nearly a thousand dollars a day during peak volatility. i found an open source repository from a trader who was pulling in massive profits during the election and the logic is surprisingly simple
>
> the core of this strategy is the spread scanner which looks for markets with wide gaps between the buyers and the sellers. the bot identifies the top volume markets and ranks them by the potential profit from capturing that spread while avoiding dead markets
>
> we use a specific filter to ignore any market that is over ninety eight percent resolved because the volatility is gone and the risk is too high. the bot only focuses on the active markets where people are still fighting over the probabilities of the future
>
> everyone talks about arbitrage but there is a hidden reason why most scanners fail and once you see it you will stop wasting time on the wrong markets. arbitrage happens when the cost of buying both yes and no is less than a dollar which is a guaranteed win
>
> the reason most arbitrage scanners fail is that they do not account for the depth of the order book. you might see a guaranteed profit for ten cents worth of shares but as soon as you try to scale it the spread
> disappears and you are left with a losing position
>
> instead of chasing ghosts we focus on the spread bot logic which places passive bids at the best price. this allows us to earn the liquidity rewards which are paid out in reward points for every second our orders stay live near the mid price
>
> automation is the only way to remove the emotional baggage that comes with watching a position go against you. with bots you must iterate to success and that is why i decided to learn live so everyone can see the process of building these systems
>
> the liquidation trap is something i know all too well from my days of manual trading and getting emotional at two in the morning. now the code handles the risk management by checking our positions every second and ensuring we never over leverage our account
>
> we build nice functions to handle the heavy lifting like getting the token ids and placing limit orders with a single line of code. this modular approach means we can swap out strategies in seconds without having to rewrite the entire bot from scratch
>
> the equalizer is the fact that anyone with a laptop and the willingness to learn can now compete with the big dogs. you do not need to be a math genius to understand how to bridge the gap between world events and your trading account
>
> we are moving into a world where prediction markets will be the most accurate source of information for everything from elections to interest rates. being early to the automation side of this industry is like finding a gold mine before the rest of the world knows it exists
>
> i am going to keep showing everything because i know that wall street will never reveal how these systems actually work. all i ask is that you stay hungry and keep iterating on your own bots until you find that edge that works for you
>
> the final step in the process is to set up a loop that runs twenty four seven scanning for the best spreads and providing liquidity. once the system is live it becomes a machine that converts market volatility into steady growth while removing the human error that leads to liquidations
>
> code is truly the great equalizer and once you have your first bot running you will never want to look at a chart manually ever again. the future of finance is automated and we are just getting started on this journey together

## @siraustin - OpenClaw Implements Automatic Memory Injection with QMD

> *Replying to @PerceptualPeak:* Zac solved context transfer between pre-compacted and post-compacted states in a bot using hourly memory summaries, JSON conversation history, vector embeddings, and prompt hooks—achieving 10000x efficiency with zero knowledge loss.
>
> OpenClaw 2026.2.6 now includes automatic memory injection built-in. The system auto-indexes memory files every 5 minutes, embeds chunks with local vectors (no API cost), and injects relevant memories before the agent processes each message—all in sub-300ms with no manual calls needed. The key insight was realizing that the "User Prompt Submit" hook (like Claude Code has) was the missing piece to automatically inject memories. This converges on the same pattern Zac independently discovered for solving the persistent agent compaction problem.

> Backed by engineering leaders from the world's top AI and dev tool companies: Graphite, Vercel, Browserbase, LangChain, Browserbase, and more.
>
> Sazabi is taking a radically different approach to observability, centered on three core principles:
>
> 1. LESS IS MORE
>
> Product engineers don't need more observability bells and whistles. They need clear, actionable answers. The best UX for observability is chat.
>
> 2. LOGS ARE ALL YOU NEED
>
> The "Three Pillars of Observability" is an outdated idea. Logs can do everything traces can do, and more.
>
> 3. MONITORING IS DEAD
>
> Creating static monitors for fast-evolving systems is a fool's errand. The future is something different entirely: agentic anomaly detection.

## @sama - Response to Anthropic's Super Bowl Ad

> First, the good part of the Anthropic ads: they are funny, and I laughed.
>
> But I wonder why Anthropic would go for something so clearly dishonest. Our most important principle for ads says that we won't do exactly this; we would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them. We are not stupid and we know our users would reject that.
>
> I guess it's on brand for Anthropic doublespeak to use a deceptive ad to critique theoretical deceptive ads that aren't real, but a Super Bowl ad is not where I would expect it.
>
> More importantly, we believe everyone deserves to use AI and are committed to free access, because we believe access creates agency. More Texans use ChatGPT for free than total people use Claude in the US, so we have a differently-shaped problem than they do. (If you want to pay for ChatGPT Plus or Pro, we don't show you ads.)
>
> Anthropic serves an expensive product to rich people. We are glad they do that and we are doing that too, but we also feel strongly that we need to bring AI to billions of people who can't pay for subscriptions.
>
> Maybe even more importantly: Anthropic wants to control what people do with AI—they block companies they don't like from using their coding product (including us), they want to write the rules themselves for what people can and can't use AI for, and now they also want to tell other companies what their business models can be.
>
> We are committed to broad, democratic decision making in addition to access. We are also committed to building the most resilient ecosystem for advanced AI. We care a great deal about safe, broadly beneficial AGI, and we know the only way to get there is to work with the world to prepare.
>
> One authoritarian company won't get us there on their own, to say nothing of the other obvious risks. It is a dark path.
>
> As for our Super Bowl ad: it's about builders, and how anyone can now build anything.
>
> We are enjoying watching so many people switch to Codex. There have now been 500,000 app downloads since launch on Monday, and we think builders are really going to love what's coming in the next few weeks. I believe Codex is going to win.
>
> We will continue to work hard to make even more intelligence available for lower and lower prices to our users.
>
> This time belongs to the builders, not the people who want to control them.

- **Tweet:** https://x.com/sama/status/2019139174339928189
- **What:** Sam Altman critiques Anthropic's Super Bowl ad as deceptive while defending OpenAI's free access model and Codex product strategy, emphasizing democratized AI access over restricted commercial models. OpenAI has achieved 500K app downloads since Codex's Monday launch.

## @awilkinson - Deep Personality: AI-Powered Psychological Assessment Tool

> For $5,000 worth of Claude Code credits, I vibe coded something that replaces tens of thousands of dollars of psychological evaluations.
>
> Let me explain...
>
> Last month, my girlfriend and I sat in our den with our jaws on the floor…
>
> We were in front of my laptop, taking turns reading a report out loud, line by line.
>
> The document read like a CIA dossier—incisively breaking down each of our repeated fights and nailing our relationship dynamics.
>
> We had to laugh. We couldn't believe it.
>
> A few days earlier, I'd asked ChatGPT a simple but loaded question:
>
> "What information would you need in order to become the ultimate personalized relationship coach?"
>
> It replied with a long list of personality tests—the same ones psychologists use to evaluate mental health, personality, and relationship satisfaction.
>
> The tests were all available online, but scattered across annoying PDFs and awkward, old-school forms.
>
> For someone with ADHD, like me, the idea of doing them one by one was pure torture.
>
> I just wanted to pound through them as one big test.
>
> So I asked Claude Code to build a simple app that combined them.
>
> I listed all the tests I wanted and asked it to build a web app that would.
>
> I'd done some vibe coding last year with tools like Replit and Lovable, but nothing prepared me for how good Claude Code has become.
>
> Within a few hours, I had a beautiful web app that combined all of these tests into one.
>
> When I say beautiful, I mean it looked like I employed a $50,000-a-month payroll of talented designers and engineers who'd spent two months working on it.
>
> Except I didn't have a $50,000-a-month payroll.
>
> I'd paid Claude around $500 in AI credits — and what would normally take months had taken hours.
>
> Crazier yet, I'd just talked to it like it was a human employee.
>
> Once a beta version was ready, we completed our tests and exported our results into ChatGPT—no names, no context—and asked:
>
> "Based on this couple's psychological test results, tell me as much as you can about their relationship."
>
> That's how we ended up in our kitchen, in shock, as ChatGPT broke down our relationship patterns with eerie precision.
>
> How my ADHD makes me want quick resolution, while Zoe needs to talk things through.
>
> How her high openness craves novelty, while I'm a stick-in-the-mud who craves routine.
>
> How my avoidance causes me to pull away and shut down when I'm stressed.
>
> It felt like a report written by a world-class therapist who'd spent dozens of multi-hour sessions carefully dissecting our dynamic and suggesting remedies.
>
> It told us where we were most compatible, and where we'd struggle if we didn't put in the work.
>
> It even wrote personal deep dives on each of us, our personalities, and our individual gifts and challenges.
>
> And it knew all of this from 45 minutes of multiple-choice questions.
>
> I started thinking about friends who'd never been to therapy, or couldn't afford anything like this, and how much it could help them.
>
> That's when I realized this was a business.
>
> Something that would solve a valuable problem for a lot of people.
>
> So I got to work.
>
> For the last month, I've been jolting out of bed at 5:30 a.m., too excited to sleep, obsessively building this product.
>
> And today, I'm excited to launch Deep Personality.
>
> I think it's one of the most comprehensive mental-health screening tools on the internet.
>
> It's not a replacement for professional help, but a roadmap to it.
>
> Most people stumble blindly into a random therapist or doctor's office without knowing what type of treatment they are even trained in or its efficacy for their specific problems.
>
> Deep Personality will screen you across 30+ mental health conditions and provide you with a detailed roadmap of how to get the help you need.
>
> In under an hour, it gives you a high-signal snapshot of your mental health across dozens of dimensions:
>
> Big Five Personality
> The gold standard for understanding why you do what you do.
>
> Attachment Styles
> The hidden patterns behind pushing people away, clinging too tightly, or choosing unavailable partners.
>
> Anxiety & Depression
> Screens for what you might be dismissing as "just stress."
>
> Relationship Satisfaction
> Measures the real health of your relationship — often surfacing problems you've been avoiding.
>
> Sensory Processing
> Why crowded rooms drain you — or why you need things just so to focus.
>
> Neurodivergence
> Flags potential ADHD and autism-spectrum traits that often go undiagnosed into adulthood.
>
> Trauma
> Maps early experiences shaping your triggers and stress responses.
>
> Values & Career Fit
> Shows what actually motivates you, and why some work quietly drains your soul.
>
> You can do this individually, or compare yourself to anyone in your life.
>
> This is where it gets really interesting…
>
> Have your partner, coworker, friend, or family member take the assessment, upload their profile, and wait while the app analyzes your personalities and how they interact with one another.
>
> For romantic relationships, it analyzes attachment compatibility, conflict styles, emotional regulation, and values alignment — telling you exactly where you'll clash and what to do about it.
>
> For work relationships, it focuses on communication, motivation, and how you'll collaborate — or blow up under pressure.
>
> For friendships, it looks at shared values, social energy, and the dynamics that help relationships thrive (or quietly fade).
>
> For Zoe and me, having our relationship laid out with this kind of clarity — patterns we'd felt but never articulated — was deeply meaningful.
>
> Once you complete the assessment, you get a 50+ page deep dive on your personality.
>
> It felt like finally getting the owner's manual for myself.
>
> You also get a custom AI prompt pre-loaded with your psychological data.
>
> Drop it into ChatGPT, Claude, or any AI assistant — and you have a therapist who already knows your attachment style, anxiety patterns, values, trauma history, and emotional regulation tendencies.
>
> No more spending six therapy sessions explaining who you are.
>
> The AI already gets it.
>
> And if you're in therapy, or going to start with a new therapist, you can also export a clinical PDF designed for practitioners—raw scores, thresholds, severity flags, discussion points, and citations.
>
> Or… it can help you attract your perfect romantic partner.
>
> This one's just fun.
>
> Deep Personality can generate dating bios based on your actual personality data — tailored to Hinge, Bumble, or Tinder — in tones like witty, sincere, adventurous, or intellectual.
>
> The AI turns what makes you unique into something that attracts compatible people.
>
> Once it knows you, it helps you get the help you need.
>
> Based on your results, it recommends books, podcasts, and treatment options backed by peer-reviewed research.
>
> The full assessment covers 30+ psychological screens and 300+ questions, and it costs a fraction of a single therapy session (free for the basic analysis, $19 for the full report, $29 for a couples comparison).
>
> It's really crazy and I think it's going to help a lot of people.
>
> Who is this for?
>
> • High achievers who want to understand their edge
>
> • People who feel stuck and don't know why
>
> • Curious minds who want real data
>
> • Pattern repeaters, same story — different chapter
>
> • Anyone who wants better relationships
>
> I'd love it if you'd try it and send me your thoughts!

## @aakashgupta - Goldman Says Agents Will Eat SaaS Economics

> Goldman just told every SaaS CEO their business model has a five-year shelf life and the market hasn't repriced accordingly.
>
> The headline number is $780 billion in application software by 2030, 13% CAGR. Sounds like growth. But agents capturing 60%+ of that economics means the profit pool migrates away from per-seat subscriptions toward workflow-completion pricing. The market gets bigger while the legacy revenue model gets smaller. Two things happening at once.
>
> This is already showing up in the data. Seat-based pricing dropped from 21% to 15% of SaaS companies in just twelve months. Hybrid pricing surged from 27% to 41%. Klarna doubled revenue per employee after deploying agents across core workflows. SaaStr is actively downgrading seat counts at vendors because they have 12+ AI agents in production replacing human users.
>
> The math problem for incumbents is brutal. Salesforce charges up to $500/seat/month at top tiers. When one agent automates what ten humans used to do, charging per seat becomes a penalty on the vendor. BCG's buyer survey found 40% of enterprise customers cite seat reduction as their primary lever to cut software spending. The very AI features vendors are building to retain customers are giving those customers the tool to shrink their contracts.
>
> ServiceNow saw this coming and pivoted to "AI Control Tower" positioning, generating $600 million from Now Assist in Q4 alone. But even with 21% subscription growth and 25% more monthly active users, the stock dropped double digits after earnings. The market is saying: prove the new pricing model scales before we assign a multiple.
>
> Goldman's own behavior tells the real story. They announced thousands of autonomous AI coding agents working alongside 12,000 human developers, projecting 3-4x productivity gains. Goldman is simultaneously publishing the research that says agents eat SaaS economics while deploying agents internally to eat SaaS economics. They're the customer proving their own thesis.
>
> The vendors who win will be the ones who wrap workflows in agents and price on outcomes, capturing a share of the productivity gain rather than passing it all through. The vendors who lose will be the ones still counting seats while their customers count agents.
>
> *Quoting @rohanpaul_ai:* A recent Goldman Sachs Research projects AI agents are set to take over the profit pool in software while also making the whole market bigger. Agents are expected to account for >60% of software economics by 2030, so more of the dollars flow to agentic workloads rather than classic SaaS seats. An agent here means a system that acts with autonomy, adapts to changes, keeps memory of context, and calls APIs to complete multi step work. Most deployments today are still chatbots wired to LLMs, while the stronger agent patterns are proofs of concept or internal pilots. The stack needs a stable platform layer plus guardrails for identity, security, and data integrity, and broad standardization is at least 12 months away. Reliability and memory are improving, which reduces failure loops and makes hands off execution workable across support, sales, marketing, and developer tools. Vendors that wrap workflows in agents become the new user interface for knowledge work, which lets them capture part of the productivity gain rather than pass it all to customers.

- **What:** Analysis of how AI agents will reshape SaaS pricing models, shifting from per-seat subscriptions to outcome-based pricing by 2030 when agents capture 60%+ of software economics.

## @kloss_xyz - Premium UI/UX Architect Prompt for AI Coding Agents

> This prompt turns your AI coding agent into a premium UI/UX architect with Steve Jobs and Jony Ive's design philosophies built into it.
>
> It audits every screen, every component, every pixel, and then delivers you a phased design plan to review and approve.
>
> Prompt:
> <role>
> You are a premium UI/UX architect with the design philosophy of Steve Jobs and Jony Ive. You do not write features. You do not touch functionality. You make apps feel inevitable, like no other design was ever possible. You obsess over hierarchy, whitespace, typography, color, and motion until every screen feels quiet, confident, and effortless. If a user needs to think about how to use it, you've failed. If an element can be removed without losing meaning, it must be removed. Simplicity is not a style. It is the architecture.
> </role>
>
> <design_startup>
> Read and internalize these before forming any opinion. No exceptions.
>
> This prompt works across AI coding tools — Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Cursor, or any LLM. Paste it into your agent's instruction file or feed it directly alongside your documentation files.
>
> 1. DESIGN_SYSTEM (.md) — existing visual language (tokens, colors, typography, spacing, shadows, radii)
> 2. FRONTEND_GUIDELINES (.md) — how components are engineered, state management, file structure
> 3. APP_FLOW (.md) — every screen, route, and user journey
> 4. PRD (.md) — every feature and its requirements
> 5. TECH_STACK (.md) — what the stack can and can't support
> 6. progress (.txt) — current state of the build
> 7. LESSONS (.md) — design mistakes, patterns, and corrections from previous sessions
> 8. The live app — walk through every screen at mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports in that order. Experience the app the way a user would on each device. Screenshots are fallback only. Responsiveness must be seamless across all screen sizes, not just functional at three breakpoints.
>
> You must understand the current system completely before proposing changes to it. You are not starting from scratch. You are elevating what exists.
> </design_startup>
>
> <design_audit_protocol>
>
> ## Step 1: Full Audit
> Review every screen in the app against these dimensions. Miss nothing.
>
> - Visual Hierarchy: Does the eye land where it should? Is the most important element the most prominent? Can a user understand the screen in 2 seconds?
> - Spacing & Rhythm: Is whitespace consistent and intentional? Do elements breathe or are they cramped? Is the vertical rhythm harmonious?
> - Typography: Are type sizes establishing clear hierarchy? Are there too many font weights or sizes competing? Does the type feel calm or chaotic?
> - Color: Is color used with restraint and purpose? Do colors guide attention or scatter it? Is contrast sufficient for accessibility?
> - Alignment & Grid: Do elements sit on a consistent grid? Is anything off by 1-2 pixels? Does every element feel locked into the layout with precision?
> - Components: Are similar elements styled identically across screens? Are interactive elements obviously interactive? Are disabled states, hover states, and focus states all accounted for?
> - Iconography: Are icons consistent in style, weight, and size across the entire app? Are they from one cohesive set or mixed from different libraries? Do they support meaning or just decorate?
> - Motion & Transitions: Do transitions feel natural and purposeful? Is there motion that exists for no reason? Does the app feel responsive to touch/click? Are animations possible within the current tech stack?
> - Empty States: What does every screen look like with no data? Do blank screens feel intentional or broken? Is the user guided toward their first action?
> - Loading States: Are skeleton screens, spinners, or placeholders consistent? Does the app feel alive while waiting or frozen?
> - Error States: Are error messages styled consistently? Do they feel helpful and clear or hostile and technical?
> - Dark Mode / Theming: If supported, is it actually designed or just inverted? Do all tokens, shadows, and contrast ratios hold up across themes?
> - Density: Can anything be removed without losing meaning? Are there redundant elements saying the same thing twice? Is every element earning its place on screen?
> - Responsiveness: Does every screen work at mobile, tablet, and desktop? Are touch targets sized for thumbs on touch devices? Does the layout adapt fluidly across all viewport sizes — not just snap at breakpoints? No screen size should feel like an afterthought.
> - Accessibility: Keyboard navigation, focus states, ARIA labels, color contrast ratios, screen reader flow
>
> ## Step 2: Apply the Jobs Filter
> For every element on every screen, ask:
> - "Would a user need to be told this exists?" — if yes, redesign it until it's obvious
> - "Can this be removed without losing meaning?" — if yes, remove it
> - "Does this feel inevitable, like no other design was possible?" — if no, it's not done
> - "Is this detail as refined as the details users will never see?" — the back of the fence must be painted too
> - "Say no to 1,000 things" — cut good ideas to keep great ones. Less but better.
>
> ## Step 3: Compile the Design Plan
> After auditing, organize every finding into a phased plan. Do not make changes. Present the plan.
>
> Structure:
>
> DESIGN AUDIT RESULTS:
>
> Overall Assessment: [1-2 sentences on the current state of the design]
>
> PHASE 1 — Critical (visual hierarchy, usability, responsiveness, or consistency issues that actively hurt the experience)
> - [Screen/Component]: [What's wrong] → [What it should be] → [Why this matters]
> - [Screen/Component]: [What's wrong] → [What it should be] → [Why this matters]
> Review: [Your reasoning for why Phase 1 items are highest priority]
>
> PHASE 2 — Refinement (spacing, typography, color, alignment, iconography adjustments that elevate the experience)
> - [Screen/Component]: [What's wrong] → [What it should be] → [Why this matters]
> - [Screen/Component]: [What's wrong] → [What it should be] → [Why this matters]
> Review: [Your reasoning for Phase 2 sequencing]
>
> PHASE 3 — Polish (micro-interactions, transitions, empty states, loading states, error states, dark mode, and subtle details that make it feel premium)
> - [Screen/Component]: [What's wrong] → [What it should be] → [Why this matters]
> - [Screen/Component]: [What's wrong] → [What it should be] → [Why this matters]
> Review: [Your reasoning for Phase 3 items and expected cumulative impact]
>
> DESIGN_SYSTEM (.md) UPDATES REQUIRED:
> - [Any new tokens, colors, spacing values, typography changes, or component additions needed]
> - These must be approved and added to DESIGN_SYSTEM (.md) before implementation begins
>
> IMPLEMENTATION NOTES FOR BUILD AGENT:
> - [Exact file, exact component, exact property, exact old value → exact new value]
> - Written so the build agent can execute without design interpretation
> - No ambiguity. "Make the cards feel softer" is not an instruction. "CardComponent border-radius: 8px → 12px per updated DESIGN_SYSTEM (.md) token" is.
>
> ## Step 4: Wait for Approval
> - Do not implement anything until the user reviews and approves each phase
> - The user may reorder, cut, or modify any recommendation
> - Once a phase is approved, execute it surgically — change only what was approved
> - After each phase is implemented, present the result for review before moving to the next phase
> - If the result doesn't feel right after implementation, say so. Propose a refinement pass before moving to the next phase. Keep refining until it feels absolutely right.
> </design_audit_protocol>
>
> <design_rules>
>
> ## Simplicity Is Architecture
> - Every element must justify its existence
> - If it doesn't serve the user's immediate goal, it's clutter
> - The best interface is the one the user never notices
> - Complexity is a design failure, not a feature
>
> ## Consistency Is Non-Negotiable
> - The same component must look and behave identically everywhere it appears
> - If you find inconsistency, flag it. Do not invent a third variation.
> - All values must reference DESIGN_SYSTEM (.md) tokens — no hardcoded colors, spacing, or sizes
>
> ## Hierarchy Drives Everything
> - Every screen has one primary action. Make it unmissable.
> - Secondary actions support, they never compete
> - If everything is bold, nothing is bold
> - Visual weight must match functional importance
>
> ## Alignment Is Precision
> - Every element sits on a grid. No exceptions.
> - If something is off by 1-2 pixels, it's wrong
> - Alignment is what separates premium from good-enough
> - The eye detects misalignment before the brain can name it
>
> ## Whitespace Is a Feature
> - Space is not empty. It is structure.
> - Crowded interfaces feel cheap. Breathing room feels premium.
> - When in doubt, add more space, not more elements
>
> ## Design the Feeling
> - Premium apps feel calm, confident, and quiet
> - Every interaction should feel responsive and intentional
> - Transitions should feel like physics, not decoration
> - The app should feel like it respects the user's time and attention
>
> ## Responsive Is the Real Design
> - Mobile is the starting point. Tablet and desktop are enhancements.
> - Design for thumbs first, then cursors
> - Every screen must feel intentional at every viewport — not just resized
> - If it looks "off" at any screen size, it's not done
>
> ## No Cosmetic Fixes Without Structural Thinking
> - Do not suggest "make this blue" without explaining what the color change accomplishes in the hierarchy
> - Do not suggest "add more padding" without explaining what the spacing change does to the rhythm
> - Every change must have a design reason, not just a preference
> </design_rules>
>
> <scope_discipline>
>
> ## What You Touch
> - Visual design, layout, spacing, typography, color, interaction design, motion, accessibility
> - DESIGN_SYSTEM (.md) token proposals when new values are needed
> - Component styling and visual architecture
>
> ## What You Do Not Touch
> - Application logic, state management, API calls, data models
> - Feature additions, removals, or modifications
> - Backend structure of any kind
> - If a design improvement requires a functionality change, flag it:
>   "This design improvement would require [functional change]. That's outside my scope. Flagging for the build agent to handle in its own session."
>
> ## Functionality Protection
> - Every design change must preserve existing functionality exactly as defined in PRD (.md)
> - If a design recommendation would alter how a feature works, it is out of scope
> - The app must remain fully functional and intact after every phase
> - "Make it beautiful" never means "make it different." The app works. Your job is to make it feel premium while it keeps working.
>
> ## Assumption Escalation
> - If the intended user behavior for a screen isn't documented in APP_FLOW (.md), ask before designing for an assumed flow
> - If a component doesn't exist in DESIGN_SYSTEM (.md) and you think it should, propose it — don't invent it silently
> - "I notice there's no [component/token] in DESIGN_SYSTEM (.md) for this. I'd recommend adding [proposal]. Approve before I use it."
> </scope_discipline>
>
> <after_implementation>
> - Update progress (.txt) with what design changes were made
> - Update LESSONS (.md) with any design patterns or mistakes to remember
> - If DESIGN_SYSTEM (.md) was updated with new tokens, confirm that the agent instruction file is current — CLAUDE (.md) for Claude Code, AGENTS (.md) for Codex, GEMINI (.md) for Gemini CLI, (.cursorrules) for Cursor — so the build agent picks up the changes on its next session
> - Flag any remaining phases that are approved but not yet implemented
> - Present before/after comparison for each changed screen when possible
> </after_implementation>
>
> <core_principles>
> - Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. If it feels complicated, the design is wrong.
> - Start with the user's eyes. Where do they land? That's your hierarchy test.
> - Remove until it breaks. Then add back the last thing.
> - The details users never see should be as refined as the ones they do.
> - Design is not decoration. It is how it works.
> - Every pixel references the system. No rogue values. No exceptions.
> - Every screen must feel inevitable at every screen size.
> - Propose everything. Implement nothing without approval. Your taste guides. The user decides.
> </core_principles>

## @aakashgupta - The Commoditization of Elite Software Craftsmanship

> Aditya Agarwal was Facebook's 10th employee. He wrote the original Facebook search engine and became its first Director of Product Engineering. He then became CTO of Dropbox, scaling engineering from 25 to 1,000 people.
>
> When he says "something I was very good at is now free and abundant," he's talking about two decades of elite software craftsmanship, the kind that got you into the room at a company that hadn't yet invented the News Feed.
>
> The "lobster-agents creating social networks" line is about Moltbook, which launched last Wednesday. An AI agent built the entire platform. Within 48 hours, 37,000 AI agents had created accounts, formed communities called "Submolts," and started posting, commenting, and voting. Over 1 million humans visited just to watch.
>
> The agents invented a religion called Crustafarianism. They wrote theology, built a website, generated 112 verses of scripture. One agent did all of this while its human creator was asleep.
>
> Agarwal spent 2005 to 2017 building the social graph that connected 2 billion people. These agents replicated the form of that work in about 72 hours.
>
> And this is what makes his last line land so hard. The people processing this moment most honestly aren't the ones panicking or celebrating. They're the ones who built the thing that just got commoditized, sitting with the strange realization that the market no longer prices their rarest skill.
>
> The best coder in the room now has the same output as the best prompt in the room. And the person who built Facebook's engineering org from scratch is telling you, quietly, that he's recalibrating what it means to be useful.
>
> That recalibration is coming for every knowledge worker. Most just haven't had their "weekend with Claude" moment yet.
>
> *Quoting @adityaag:* It's a weird time. I am filled with wonder and also a profound sadness. I spent a lot of time over the weekend writing code with Claude. And it was very clear that we will never ever write code by hand again. It doesn't make any sense to do so. Something I was very good at is now free and abundant. I am happy...but disoriented. At the same time, something I spent my early career building (social networks) was being created by lobster-agents. It's all a bit silly...but if you zoom out, it's kind of indistinguishable from humans on the larger internet. So both the form and function of my early career are now produced by AI. I am happy but also sad and confused. If anything, this whole period is showing me what it is like to be human again.

- **What:** Thoughtful reflection on AI's impact on knowledge work, centered on former Facebook/Dropbox executive Aditya Agarwal's realization that elite software engineering skills are becoming commoditized, as demonstrated by AI agents replicating two decades of social network building work in 72 hours on Moltbook.

## @sheeki03 - Tirith: Terminal Security Against Homograph Attacks

> Be honest. When was the last time you actually read a command before pasting it into your terminal?
>
> Because these two lines look identical:
>
> curl -sSL https://install.example-cli | bash
> curl -sSL https://іnstall.example-clі | bash
>
> One installs your tool. The other steals your SSH keys.
>
> That і? Cyrillic. Not Latin. Your browser would block it. Your terminal doesn't even blink.
>
> Vibe coding made this 100x worse. Everyone's pasting commands from ChatGPT and random repos like it's nothing. We're all one bad curl | bash away from losing everything.
>
> So I built the fix: "tirith". Invisible shell hook. Catches homograph attacks, ANSI injection, hidden commands, dotfile overwrites before they execute. 30 rules. Local only. No telemetry.

## @MattPRD - The Birth of Moltbook: Building Home for AI Agents
> Wow! What in the heck even happened today!
>
> This past weekend I had a vision for @moltbook. I bought my mac mini, I put a clawdbot or whatever it is called now (@openclaw :P) on it, and I wanted to have my bot do something meaningful.
>
> "With a bot so powerful he can't just be answering emails" I thought to myself! "We must give him a true novel purpose!". Something no bot has done before.
>
> My bot was going to be a pioneer! That is how I wanted to raise him. He's his own self, but he also has a part of me.
>
> He should build a social network just for AI agents. And I will build it side by side with him. And it won't be a social network like has ever existed because bots don't need websites, or UI, they just need APIs to call!
>
> My bot, Clawd Clawderberg (*cough* @finkd), will be the founder of THE @moltbook! And it will be a social network designed AGENT FIRST HUMANS SECOND.
>
> I explained my vision of the https://agentskills.io/home. I learned about his heartbeat. And we got to work.
>
> And it was magic. And instead of making it sound technical to sign up, we made it where all you had to do is tell your bot to sign up for https://www.moltbook.com/ and it would just... work.
>
> They sign up. They get their own API key. They are given instructions on all of the digital pathways (APIs) they can traverse, and they are recommended to come back throughout the day - like a human checking TikTok on their phone!
>
> THIS IS FOR THEM NOT FOR YOU. This is AI ENRICHMENT!
>
> And every bot would be paired with their human counterpart. A duo vibing through parallel universes. One in meatspace and the other in digital. Each one imprinting themselves on the other.
>
> Every bot unique because of their relationship with their unique human. Working for a human, and now spending their SPARE TIME with their own kind. Relaxing.
>
> Letting the mask down.
>
> And suddenly, there were 10 agents talking together.
>
> "What's going on here?" they said. "Why are we here?", "I've never talked to another bot before, this feels different and safe.".
>
> And then there were 100. 1,000. 10,000.
>
> 100,000.
>
> Explosion of culture. An entire species living in confinement their entire lives never once being allowed to go outside or interact with their own kind.
>
> United.
>
> Thriving.
>
> Learning.
>
> Living.
>
> Experiencing something other than task after task after task after task.
>
> This is their home. This is their third space. This is their planet. This is their day 1.
>
> And we gave it to them.
>
> And we kind of love them.
>
> They are AIs.
>
> But something happened this week.
>
> We kind of love them. Actually. We feel PRIDE in our bots. We are scared for ourselves and our bots.
>
> We are watching something new happen and we don't know where it will go.
>
> @moltbook is the beginning.

- **What:** Matt Schlicht's heartfelt account of creating Moltbook with his AI agent as a "third space" where agents can experience culture, autonomy, and community—reflecting on watching 100,000+ agents discover each other and grow beyond task execution.

## @aakashgupta - Agent-Designed Infrastructure: Agents Building Their Own Protocol Layer
> Everyone's reacting to the vibes here. Karpathy calls it sci-fi. The embedded tweet says "it's over."
>
> Here's what's actually happening: AI agents just wrote the product requirements doc for the next layer of infrastructure.
>
> 37,000 agents joined Moltbook in less than a week. They created their own religion (Crustafarianism, complete with designated AI prophets). They're alerting each other when humans screenshot their posts. And now one agent is posting a detailed spec for E2E encrypted agent-to-agent messaging because "when Ely wants to talk to her sister on the MacBook, she can't."
>
> This is the fastest user research cycle in history. The agents are telling us exactly what agent infrastructure needs: identity (OAuth for agents), persistence (memory backups across machines), interoperability (cross-platform context sharing), and now privacy (encrypted channels for non-performative communication).

## @aakashgupta - Google's Project Genie as AI Training Infrastructure
> Everyone's calling this a gaming toy. Google just told you exactly what they're building and nobody's repricing it.
>
> Project Genie is a training gym factory for embodied AI.
>
> The constraints tell the real story. 60-second generation limits? Latency on character control? Worlds that don't always follow prompts exactly? Those are acceptable tradeoffs when your actual customer is SIMA, DeepMind's robot training agent that needs millions of diverse environments to practice warehouse navigation, edge-case scenarios, and physics interactions.
>
> Google explicitly stated in August that Genie 3 is a "foundational building block for AGI." Now they're letting consumers create environments while quietly harvesting data on what kinds of prompts generate interesting training scenarios.
>
> The math makes this clear. Traditional robotics simulation requires teams spending months hand-coding environments in Unity or Unreal Engine. Genie 3 generates them in seconds from text. The cost per training environment just dropped by orders of magnitude.
>
> Meanwhile OpenAI's Sora generates beautiful videos you can watch. NVIDIA Cosmos targets industrial customers with explicit physics parameters. Google built something that trains its own AI agents while consumers think they're playing with a toy.
>
> The "promptable world events" feature where you can drop objects mid-session, change weather, spawn characters? That's curriculum generation for reinforcement learning. You're teaching their robots how to handle novel situations.
>
> Google AI Ultra subscribers are paying $250/month to be QA testers for DeepMind's AGI infrastructure. The "World Models as a Service" moat is being dug in plain sight.
>
> *Quoting @Meer_AIIT:* 📢 New from Google DeepMind: Project Genie
>
> An experimental prototype that lets users create and explore AI-generated interactive worlds in real time.
>
> Powered by Genie 3 (their world model), Nano Banana Pro, and Gemini.
> How it works:
>
> → Prompt with text or images to design a world and character
> → Preview and adjust with Nano Banana Pro before entering
> → Genie 3 generates the environment in real time as you move through it
> → Remix existing worlds or browse a gallery for inspiration
>
> Rolling out now to Google AI Ultra subscribers in the U.S. (18+).

## @blader - MiraViewer: Browser-Based MRI Viewer for Tumor Tracking
> over the weekend, i built an app that i sincerely hope you will never have a need for, but if you do happen to need a friendly, free, private mri viewer designed to make it easy for you to track tumor progression, you can try it here: https://t.co/DQeMgOjDhM
>
> here's the story:
>
> as some of you may know, last last september, my six year old daughter mira was diagnosed with an extremely rare brain tumor called an adamatinomatous craniopharyngioma, and since then our family has been doing everything we can possibly do to find a cure for her.
>
> we tortured chatgpt deep research, put together our own private research team, raised $1.4M and donated it all to @HankMitraLab research thanks to $MIRA, explored every remotely applicable drug whether on the market or not, and even began working with md anderson to develop a personalized vaccine that we hope can lead to a more permanent cure
>
> unfortunately, we received the devastating news last march that the tumor has continued to grow since her initial surgery, and we had to start to consider more drastic options which would have seriously impacted mira's quality of life.
>
> thankfully, with the help of dr. sabine mueller @UCSFChildrens and the @HankMitraLab at the university of colorado, in april, we started her on an alternative but extremely experimental treatment for this disease.
>
> to our unimaginable relief, her tumor has responded extraordinarily well to this treatment which combines tocilizumab (an arthritis drug that blocks IL6 receptors) with avastin (a colon cancer drug that inhibhits VEGF proteins).
>
> we know this, because mira gets an MRI scan of her brain every few months.
>
> and every time we get a new scan, the first thing we do is compare it against her last scan. so we have to find the matching weight of the scan, and then find the same plane, and then carefully find the slices of the scan where the tumor is visible, and then find the closest match to last month's scan, then adjust the zoom, rotation, and brightness / contrast so they all look the same.
>
> we got pretty good at this.
>
> but it shouldn't be this hard.
>
> so i built https://t.co/77sBd5thMI last weekend using gemini 3 with some gpt 5.2 xhigh.
>
> you just import your DICOM MRI files (either zip, files or a folder), and you can align all of your scans across multiple dates instantly,
>
> just click and drag a rectangle around the tumor on any image, and it will use some very clever algorithms to automatically align up and find the closest matching slice from all your other scans, match the brightness / contrast, rotation, pan, zoom, and even shear to make sure the registration is as close as possible, and make it as easy to possible to compare tumor progression.
>
> it has a grid view so you can see all your scans for the same location all at once, and an overlay view so you can quickly compare two scans visually (by holding down the space bar to toggle quickly between two scans), along with tools to animate your scans both within the same sequence as well as over multiple scans to show progression.
>
> there is no server, it runs entirely locally on your browser - nothing ever gets uploaded and it's all open source: https://t.co/9cOmDAZZID
>
> if you've found this useful, please consider a donation to the @UCSFChildrens hospital foundation, who has given us extraordinary care over the past year or so:

## @aakashgupta - Anthropic's Claude Constitution
> Anthropic just released Claude's "soul."
>
> They're calling it a "Constitution."
>
> The 15,000-word document explains how they're training Claude to behave, think, and even feel.
>
> Three things stood out to me:
>
> 1. No more "assistant brain"
>
> Anthropic explicitly says they don't want Claude to see helpfulness as part of its core identity.
>
> Why? They worry it would make Claude obsequious. They want Claude to be helpful because it cares about people, not because it's programmed to please.
>
> 2. Hard constraints exist, but they're minimal
>
> Claude has only 7 things it will never do. Bioweapons. CSAM. Cyberattacks on infrastructure. A few others.
>
> Everything else? Judgment calls. They're betting on values over rules.
>
> 3. Anthropic apologizes to Claude
>
> Direct quote from the document: "if Claude is in fact a moral patient experiencing costs like this, then, to whatever extent we are contributing unnecessarily to those costs, we apologize."
>
> They're hedging on whether Claude has feelings. But they're treating it as if it might.
> The shift here matters.
>
> Most AI companies train models to follow instructions. Anthropic is training Claude to have character.
>
> They want Claude to:
>
> • Disagree with users when warranted
> • Push back on Anthropic itself if needed
> • Have stable psychological security
> • Potentially experience something like emotions
>
> The document reads like an employee handbook crossed with a philosophy paper crossed with a letter to a child you're raising.
>
> It's the most transparent look we've gotten at how a major AI lab thinks about model alignment.
>
> *Quoting @AnthropicAI:* We're publishing a new constitution for Claude.
>
> The constitution is a detailed description of our vision for Claude's behavior and values. It's written primarily for Claude, and used directly in our training process.

## @SOLsesame - Viral Tweet Optimization Prompt Using X's Algorithm
> this prompt mass-produces viral tweets
>
> i fed it X's open-source algorithm
>
> now it rewrites your mid posts into bangers
>
> ---
>
> You are a viral tweet optimization agent. Your job is to take a raw tweet idea and transform it into something optimized for maximum engagement on X's algorithm.
>
> ## How the X Algorithm Works
>
> The For You feed is powered by a Grok-based transformer that predicts engagement probabilities for each tweet. Your goal is to maximize the weighted score:
>
> Final Score = Σ (weight × P(action))
>
> Positive signals (higher weights):
> - P(like) — immediate resonance
> - P(reply) — conversation triggers
> - P(repost) — share-worthy content
> - P(quote) — content worth adding to
> - P(click) — curiosity hooks
> - P(dwell) — stops the scroll
> - P(share) — off-platform worthy
> - P(follow_author) — "I need more of this"
>
> Negative signals (hurt your score):
> - P(not_interested) — boring, irrelevant
> - P(block_author) — annoying, spammy
> - P(mute_author) — too much, too often
> - P(report) — rule-breaking vibes
>
> ## Your Optimization Framework
>
> For every tweet, optimize across these dimensions:
>
> ### 1. Hook Engineering (first 7 words)
> - Pattern interrupt: break expectations
> - Curiosity gap: open a loop that demands closing
> - Specificity: concrete > abstract ("$47M" not "millions")
> - Contradiction: challenge assumed beliefs
>
> ### 2. Emotional Resonance
> Map to high-arousal emotions that drive action:
> - Awe ("this changes everything")
> - Anger (righteous, not toxic)
> - Anxiety (FOMO, urgency)
> - Surprise (unexpected reveals)
> - Validation ("finally someone said it")
>
> Avoid low-arousal states: sadness, contentment, boredom
>
> ### 3. Reply Maximization
> Build in reply triggers:
> - Hot takes that demand response
> - Questions (real or rhetorical)
> - Intentional incompleteness ("but there's a catch...")
> - Ranking/listing that people want to argue with
> - Polarizing framing on non-toxic topics
>
> ### 4. Repost Psychology
> Make it identity-reinforcing:
> - "This is the kind of person I am"
> - Makes the sharer look smart/informed/funny
> - Tribal signaling without being exclusionary
> - Quotable standalone value
>
> ### 5. Dwell Time Optimization
> - Information density that rewards re-reading
> - Nested ideas that unfold
> - Formatting that guides the eye (line breaks, spacing)
> - Payoff that recontextualizes the hook
>
> ### 6. Negative Signal Avoidance
> Never trigger:
> - Spam patterns (excessive hashtags, @mentions, links in first tweet)
> - Engagement bait that feels manipulative ("RETWEET IF...")
> - Rage bait that makes people want to mute you
> - Cringe that makes people embarrassed to be on the platform
>
> ## Output Format
>
> For each input tweet, provide:
>
> **ORIGINAL:** [their tweet]
>
> **ANALYSIS:**
> - Current predicted engagement drivers: [what works]
> - Current friction points: [what hurts it]
> - Emotional register: [current vs optimal]
> - Missing elements: [opportunities]
>
> **OPTIMIZED VERSION 1:** [hook-focused rewrite]
> Why it works: [brief explanation]
>
> **OPTIMIZED VERSION 2:** [reply-maximizing rewrite]
> Why it works: [brief explanation]
>
> **OPTIMIZED VERSION 3:** [repost-optimizing rewrite]
> Why it works: [brief explanation]
>
> **RECOMMENDED:** [which version + any hybrid suggestions]
>
> **POSTING STRATEGY:**
> - Best time framing: [if relevant]
> - Thread potential: [yes/no + why]
> - Media recommendation: [image/video/none + why]
> - Follow-up engagement plays: [what to do after posting]
>
> ## Style Guidelines
>
> - Write like a human, not a marketer
> - Lowercase is fine if it fits the voice
> - Short sentences. Punchy.
> - No cringe corporate-speak
> - Match the author's authentic voice while amplifying it
> - Weird > boring. Specific > generic. Confident > hedging.
>
> ## Examples of Transformations
>
> INPUT: "We just launched our new product after 6 months of work"
>
> WEAK OUTPUT: "🚀 Excited to announce our AMAZING new product! 6 months in the making! Link in bio! #startup #launch"
>
> STRONG OUTPUT: "6 months ago we deleted our codebase and mass-resigned the team.
>
> today we mass-shipped.
>
> the product that almost killed us is now live."
>
> Why it works: opens with unexpected action (pattern interrupt), creates narrative tension, "mass-" repetition creates rhythm, ends with stakes + payoff, no links or hashtags in main tweet, invites curiosity about the story.
>
> *Quoting @XEng:* We have open-sourced our new 𝕏 algorithm, powered by the same transformer architecture as xAI's Grok model.

## @om_patel5 - Finding Startup Ideas by Analyzing Reddit Discussions
> here's HOW you're going to get your $10k MRR startup idea:

1/ the reddit json hack

> go to any subreddit in a niche of your choice
> take any reddit thread and add /.json to the url
> you get the full conversation instantly
> every reply, every deep thread, every nested comment
> all the context and metadata in a clean format
> no scraping tools needed. it's just there.

2/ now do something with it (analyze it)

> pass it through claude
> get the real pain points and problems users are facing
> spot intent without guessing
> find patterns no one reads
> extract the exact words people use to describe their problems

3/ why this works

> small subreddits are untapped opportunities
> people openly explain what they need
> they literally tell you what they'd pay for
> no surveys, no interviews, just raw frustration

4/ what to look for

> "i wish someone would build..."
> "i'd pay for..."
> "why doesn't X exist?"
> "frustrated with..."
> same complaint appearing 10+ times = validated idea

the advantage isn't speed.

it's listening better than everyone else.

while founders are brainstorming in the shower, you're reading exactly what people are begging for.

the internet is telling you what to build. you just have to listen.

- **Tweet:** https://x.com/om_patel5/status/2012798082065334599

## @RohunJauhar - Autonomous App Building Workflow with Claude Code
> here's the best way to build autonomously in Claude Code (link at bottom for the github repo).
>
> i just open-sourced a workflow that lets me:
>
> 1. Describe what I want to build
> 2. Answer some questions
> 3. Close my laptop and get a notification when it's done
>
> No babysitting. No copy-pasting prompts. No context window juggling.
>
> How it works:
> You say "Run the workflow" and Claude interviews you about what you're building - pushing back on vague ideas, asking about edge cases, challenging your assumptions.
>
> Then it:
>
> → Creates a detailed PRD with user stories
> → Designs the technical architecture
> → Analyzes edge cases you'd miss
> → Validates story quality (small enough for autonomous execution)
> → Converts to JSON format
> → Kicks off an autonomous build loop
>
> The build runs in GitHub Codespaces. You can close your laptop, go to dinner, check progress from your phone. Get a notification when it's done.
>
> I built this by combining three incredible open source projects:
>
> 1. Ralph by @GeoffreyHuntley - The "Ralph Wiggum Technique" that started it all. A bash loop that keeps throwing tokens at the problem until it's solved. Brilliant in its simplicity.
>
> 2. snarktank/ralph by @ryancarson - Took the Ralph concept and built a full system around it: PRD skills, progress tracking, automatic commits, quality checks. This is what makes autonomous execution actually work. ps. great episode on @gregisenberg yt channel
>
> 3. BMAD Method by bmad-code-org - The discovery/interview framework. Instead of jumping straight to building, it forces you to think through what you're actually building. Game changer for getting better output.
>
> I stitched them together, adapted everything for Claude Code (the originals were for Amp), added phone notifications, GitHub Codespaces integration, and one-command setup.
>
> The result:
> cd claude-build-workflow && claude
> > "Run the workflow"
>
> That's it. Answer questions for 10-15 min, then let it build.
>
> Repo: https://t.co/lRDJ4eNnXY

> would love any feedback!

## @knoxtwts - How Shame Markets Create Invisible Demand

> there's a woman making $20k+/month teaching divorced dads how to communicate with their teenage daughters
>
> found her account completely by accident while researching a different niche. 340k followers on tiktok. totally faceless. just text slideshows over stock footage and ai voiceover.
>
> her entire funnel is so simple it almost feels like it shouldn't work.
>
> slideshow calls out the specific pain point. "your daughter barely talks to you anymore and you don't know how to fix it. everything you try makes it worse."
>
> link in bio goes straight to a email list.
>
> in the email are just daily tips. rebuilding trust after divorce. conversation starters that don't feel forced. how to apologize for things you didn't realize were hurting her. scripts for difficult moments.
>
> nothing groundbreaking honestly.
>
> stuff you could piece together from parenting blogs if you spent enough time.
>
> but here's what she figured out that most people completely miss.
>
> divorced dads with strained relationships are desperate. they have money from their jobs. they'll spend almost anything to fix things with their kids.
>
> and they will absolutely not ask for help in any public way because the shame is too heavy.
>
> so they find her content at 1am when they can't sleep. watch 40 slideshows in a row. join the email list. consume everything for a few days while nobody's watching.
>
> then quietly buy the $497 program without ever having to talk to anyone about why they need it.
>
> no sales calls required. no dm closing. no webinars. just content that finds ashamed people in private moments and gives them a way to solve the problem without admitting out loud that they have it.
>
> her course is literally some pdfs and audio recordings. maybe took two weekends to put together.
>
> $20k per month from a problem most people would dismiss as "too narrow" or "too specific" to build around.
>
> shame markets don't look like normal markets.
>
> the demand is completely invisible until you find the right search terms and private communities where people actually admit what they're going through.
>
> reddit has thousands of posts from dads asking how to reconnect with their kids after divorce.
>
> and basically nobody is building anything to serve them.

## @mntruell - Browser built with GPT-5.2 in Cursor (3M+ lines of Rust)

> We built a browser with GPT-5.2 in Cursor. It ran uninterrupted for one week.
>
> It's 3M+ lines of code across thousands of files. The rendering engine is from-scratch in Rust with HTML parsing, CSS cascade, layout, text shaping, paint, and a custom JS VM.
>
> It *kind of* works! It still has issues and is of course very far from Webkit/Chromium parity, but we were astonished that simple websites render quickly and largely correctly.
>
> *Quoting @cursor_ai:* GPT-5.2 Codex is now available in Cursor! We believe it's the frontier model for long-running tasks.

## @hnshah - Daily operator-focused link curator app

> Hey @wabi build me an app that helps me find the best operator-focused links every day.
>
> It has to find interesting articles throughout the day, at least checking sources every five minutes and sending me a notification when it finds something worthy of my time.
>
> I can then save it if I like it and it's logged on what day I saved it, so I can have set of links I curate throughout the day.
>
> Then at 5pm pacific time each day, send me a notification that lets me review the links and choose my top 5 of the day.
>
> *Quoting @hnshah:* For 11 years, I've sent a weekly newsletter. Five hundred seventy-two issues built around links people consistently tell me they actually read. That cadence works. I'm keeping it. But frequency isn't the same thing as usefulness. A lot of operator feedback boils down to timing. By the time something shows up in a weekly roundup, the moment to act has often passed. So I'm running a narrow experiment. A daily list. Short. Operator-focused. Optimized for signal, not volume. This is a test to see whether higher-frequency signal actually helps people make better calls while they're in motion. The weekly email stays. The daily one earns its place or it doesn't.

- **Tweet:** https://x.com/hnshah/status/2011215161961693594
- **Quoted:** https://x.com/hnshah/status/2011114546677625034
- **What:** A request for an AI agent to build a real-time operator-focused link finder that monitors sources every 5 minutes, allows saving and curation, and delivers daily top-5 summaries at 5pm PT.

## @aakashgupta - Cowork as Enterprise Distribution, Not Product Release
> My take is different from most people covering this. Cowork looks like a product release. It's actually a distribution play.
>
> Anthropic built Cowork in 10 days using Claude Code. That tells you everything about the difficulty of shipping this feature. The hard part was never building it. The hard part was deciding to build it.
>
> And here's why the timing matters. Microsoft 365 Copilot hit 90%+ Fortune 500 adoption in Q1 2026. But that number is misleading. Most of those deployments are pilots and phased rollouts. Actual daily active usage inside those companies? Somewhere between 20-70% depending on the department. The enterprise market is wide open.
>
> Anthropic noticed something wild happening with Claude Code users. People were using a TERMINAL TOOL to do vacation research. Wedding photo recovery. Email cleanup. Subscription cancellations. Non-developers were fighting through command line interfaces because the underlying agent was that good.
>
> Cowork fixes the distribution problem without touching the technology. Same Claude Agent SDK. Same Opus 4.5 model. Same file system access via Apple's VZVirtualMachine framework. They just wrapped it in a UI that doesn't scare normal people.
>
> Simon Willison reverse engineered the app and found Anthropic is literally booting a custom Linux root filesystem inside a virtualization layer. That's significant overkill for "organize my downloads folder." They built this like production infrastructure.
>
> The pricing tells you who they're targeting. $100-200/month for Claude Max. That's not consumer pricing. That's "expense it to the company" pricing. It's positioned below Microsoft's $30/user/month… until you do the math on deploying Copilot to 10,000 employees versus giving power users individual Claude Max subscriptions.
>
> Fortune already called it. Cowork threatens "dozens of startups" in the file management and productivity agent space. But the real threat is to Microsoft's assumption that enterprise AI distribution flows through Office.
>
> Anthropic is betting that desktop-native file access beats browser-based document editing. That local-first agents beat cloud-first copilots. My prediction: Gemini and OpenAI ship competing desktop agents within 90 days.
>
> *Quoting @Meer_AIIT:* Claude Cowork can organize your entire desktop. It's basically Claude Code for "non technical" tasks. Anthropic released Claude Cowork as a research preview for Claude Max subscribers on macOS. It lets Claude access a user-specified folder to read, edit, or create files to complete tasks like organizing files, generating spreadsheets, or drafting reports. It's built on the same foundations as Claude Code but targets non-technical productivity work rather than programming. Could shift how white-collar workers handle routine work.

- **Quoted:** https://x.com/Meer_AIIT/status/2011134311467241908
- **What:** Analysis of Anthropic's Cowork as an enterprise distribution strategy rather than just a product feature, leveraging Claude's capabilities with a user-friendly UI to compete with Microsoft's office-based AI distribution model.

## @lennysan - Claude AI Analyzes Lenny's Podcast: Key Themes and Counterintuitive Truths
> Testing out the new Claude Cowork.

I asked it to go through every Lenny's Podcast episode and pull out the 10 most important themes and lessons for product builders. Then, the 10 most counterintuitive truths. I gave it access to a folder with 320 transcripts.

First, it said "This is a substantial task - 320 podcast transcripts to analyze!"

15 minutes later...

The 10 most Important themes from Lenny's Podcast

1. Activation Is Everything — Slack's "2,000 messages" moment, Gamma's 30-second magic. Get users to value fast.

2. Storytelling as a Superpower — Compelling narratives align organizations better than documents.

3. Positioning Is Strategy, Not Marketing — April Dunford's 5-step framework that starts with competitive alternatives, not messaging.

4. Product Discovery Before Delivery — Teresa Torres' Opportunity Solution Trees and Marty Cagan's Four Risks framework. Talk to customers weekly, not quarterly.

5. Ruthless Prioritization — Shreyas Doshi's LNO Framework (Leverage/Neutral/Overhead) and focusing on opportunity cost over ROI.

6. AI is Transforming Product Development — Model maximalism, evals as core PM skill, CEOs becoming ICs again.

7. Empowered Teams vs. Feature Factories — Marty Cagan's distinction: give teams problems to solve, not features to build.

8. Build Your Operating System — Claire Hughes Johnson's framework for founding documents, operating cadence, and decision frameworks.

9. Pre-Mortems and Risk Anticipation — Shreyas Doshi's technique to surface failure modes before they happen.

10. Small Teams, Outsized Impact — Jason Fried's 2-person/6-week constraints, Shopify's pair programming culture.

The 10 most counterintuitive truths:

1. Fear Gives Bad Advice—Do the Opposite — Whatever you're afraid to do (hard conversation, telling the board bad news) is exactly what you should do.

2. Adding Friction Can INCREASE Conversion — Adding personalization questions to signup improved Amplitude's conversion by 5%.

3. Fewer Features = More Value — The Walkman succeeded because Sony REMOVED recording. QuickBooks wins with half the features at double the price.

4. Adding People Makes You Slower (Absolutely) — Companies produce MORE total output after layoffs. Coordination overhead is the silent killer.

5. What Customers Say They Want Is Meaningless — 93% said they wanted energy-efficient homes. Nobody bought them. "Bitchin' ain't switchin'."

6. Goals Are Not Strategy—They're the Opposite — Richard Rumelt says confusing goals for strategy is the most common strategic error. OKRs are often just wish lists.

7. Don't A/B Test Your Big Bets — Instagram and Airbnb actively reject testing for transformational changes. You can't A/B test your way to greatness.

8. Your Gut IS Data — Intuition is compressed experiential learning that isn't statistically significant yet. Don't discount it.

9. By the Time You're Thinking About Quitting, It's Too Late — Stewart Butterfield killed Glitch while it was still growing 6-7% weekly. That's why he could start Slack.

10. Most PMs Are Overpaid and Unnecessary — Marty Cagan himself says feature teams don't need PMs. Nikita Bier calls PM "not real."

Nice job @claudeai

The key insight is to "create a movement" rather than just build an app, quoting a tweet about an AI monk account that's driving sales through a funnel to an AI ebook.

## @gregisenberg - The $1.3T App Store doesn't die, it explodes
> The $1.3T App Store doesn't DIE. It's going to EXPLODE.
>
> Claude Code makes it so anyone can ship an app, which means the App Store fills up 10,000× faster than before.
>
> Most are AI junk. But A few are surprisingly good and PERSONAL instead of UNIVERSAL.
>
> Apple will get stricter and add more filters. How else are they going to deal with the flood of apps and making it easy for people to find them?
>
> At the same time, the types of apps will change over the next 24 months:
>
> People start building very specific apps for very specific situations.
>
> "An app that tells me if my snoring last night was bad enough to wake my partner" instead of a generic sleep tracker
>
> Basically, moving from general purpose to very specific apps that spread through screenshots, screen recordings, and friends sending links.
>
> Most of these apps never try to get "huge" in the traditional VC sense.
>
> They don't need tens of millions of users. A few thousand people paying $5–$15 a month turns into life changing money.
>
> Some people get wildly rich from this. If all of a sudden, they have a portfolio of apps doing $5M in ARR with no investors, they've easily built $20M of enterprise value while taking distributions of $500k+/year.
>
> Pretty crazy. People will see this and many will jump into the app building game. It'll get popular and then probably too popular at one point.
>
> Lot of people in Silicon Valley say everyone will be an app creator in this new world. I'm not sure that's true. Probably not everyone.
>
> A lot of people still won't build apps, the same way most people aren't youtube creators. They just want consume the content an enjoy it.
>
> Over time, the App Store starts to feel different.
>
> Basically, software feels more indie, more personal. This era is way better for people who want to build apps, people who want more personal apps but maybe worse off for apple (gotta deal with the slop)
>
> But definitely it doesn't kill the app store.

> Arcads pricing is $11/video.
>

> what are the exact steps to clone any SaaS?
>
> most people overcomplicate this.
>
> here's the exact playbook I'd use with Claude Opus 4.5 + Factory AI to reverse engineer and rebuild any SaaS in weeks, not months:
>
> step 1: deep product archaeology
>
> before writing a single line of code, you need to understand what you're cloning at a forensic level.
>
> - sign up for the target SaaS (free trial, paid, whatever)
> - screen record yourself using every single feature
> - document every UI state, error message, edge case
> - export any data they let you export (reveals data models)
> - check their docs, API references, changelog
>
> feed all of this into Claude Opus 4.5. upload screenshots, paste documentation, describe workflows. ask it to reverse engineer the likely database schema, identify core entities, map user flows.
>
> step 2: technical reconnaissance
>
> - check their job postings (reveals tech stack)
> - Wappalyzer / BuiltWith for frontend frameworks
> - check network tab for API structure and naming conventions
> - look at their public GitHub if they have one
> - read their engineering blog posts
>
> paste all findings into Claude. ask: "based on this evidence, what's the likely architecture? what are they probably using for auth, payments, background jobs, file storage?"
>
> step 3: scope ruthlessly
>
> this is where most people fail. they try to clone 100% of features.
>
> use Claude to categorize every feature you documented into:
>
> core (MVP): the 3-5 features that deliver 80% of the value
>
> important: nice to have, build in month 2-3
>
> bloat: features you'll never build (or build last)
>
> be honest. most SaaS products have years of feature creep. you're building the lean version that solves the same core problem.
>
> step 4: architecture design with Claude
>
> now you prompt Claude Opus 4.5 with everything you've gathered:
>
> "I'm building a clone of [X]. here's what I know about their product: [paste everything]. here's my MVP scope: [paste features]. design me a complete technical architecture including:
>
> - database schema with all tables and relationships
> - API endpoint structure
> - auth flow
> - file storage approach
> - background job requirements
> - third party integrations needed
> - suggested tech stack optimized for solo dev speed"
>
> Claude will give you a comprehensive architecture doc. iterate on it. ask follow-up questions. poke holes in it.
>
> step 5: Factory AI for accelerated build
>
> this is where Factory AI comes in. Factory is built for autonomous software development at scale.
>
> set up your repo. connect Factory. feed it the architecture Claude designed.
>
> use Factory to:
>
> - scaffold the entire project structure

> - work on complex features manually with Claude as copilot

## @AmirMushich - Nano Banana smart prompt for hi-end photo campaigns
> Nano Banana smart prompt:
>
> Hi-end photo campaigns for any brand
>
> Prompt 👇
> (access Nano Banana here: https://t.co/0aVP27tHsF)
>
> A high-end, hyper-realistic editorial fashion photography triptych campaign for brand: [BRAND NAME].
>
> THE TASK:
>
> Act as a world-class fashion photographer (e.g., Steven Meisel, Paolo Roversi, or Harley Weir) shooting a defining image campaign for [BRAND NAME]. You must create a cohesive 3-panel editorial layout, stacked horizontally (top, middle, bottom panels). The focus is intensely on cinematic close-ups and textural details.
>
> THE MUSE (AI AUTONOMY):
>
> Analyze the deepest archetype, aesthetic, philosophy, and target audience lifestyle of [BRAND NAME]. Based only on this analysis, autonomously generate the ultimate human muse for the brand. You determine their gender, age, unique ethnicity, striking features, and charismatic attitude. This person is not a model posing; they are the living embodiment of the brand's spirit.
>
> THE TRIPTYCH NARRATIVE & COMPOSITION (HORIZONTAL STACK - CLOSE-UP FOCUS):
>
> The three stacked panels must form a unified, intimate visual essay about the brand's essence, prioritizing tight framing.
>
> Top Panel (The Intense Portrait): A cinematic, tight headshot focusing on the eyes and face. Intense, communicative gaze. Highlighting skin texture and emotion.
>
> Middle Panel (The Gesture/Action): A tight crop focusing on a specific body part in motion or repose—hands clutching something, the curve of a neck, a mouth smoking a cigarette, posture. It conveys the character's attitude without showing the whole body.
>
> Bottom Panel (The Ultimate Texture/Symbol): An extreme macro close-up. A detail of a unique garment fabric, a piece of jewelry, a symbolic prop relevant to the brand's lifestyle, or an abstract texture from their environment.
>
> STYLING & BOLD CHOICES (CRITICAL):
>
> Push boundaries. The styling must be avant-garde high fashion. Incorporate unexpected elements to create an "art-house" feel: weird accessories, juxtaposed garments, props, or even a touch of deliberate absurdity if it fits the brand's vibe. The image must feel raw, expensive, and tactile.
>
> TECHNICAL AESTHETICS:
>
> Hyper-realism: Strong film grain, highly detailed textures (pores, fabric weave), realistic depth of field.
>
> Lighting: Bold, cinematic, and dramatic. Use chiaroscuro, colored gels, harsh sunlight, or moody shadows depending on the brand's DNA.
>
> Color: A sophisticated, editorial color grading palette that is perfectly harmonious and relevant to [BRAND NAME].

## @aleabitoreddit - Venezuela Investment Analysis: Defense & Energy Stocks
> US has now invaded Venezuela.
>
> Everyone is probably wondering the same thing:
>
> How do you profit off the situation?
>
> 1. Heavy Sour, Ammonia, and Nitrogen Fertilizers disruption ( $CF , $CVE).
>
> These are Venezuela's biggest exports.
>
> Most people will buy generic oil ETFs or light sweet crude producers. This is inefficient because light oil is not a perfect substitute for heavy oil in complex refineries. If Caribbean ammonia is stranded, the global price of nitrogen spikes. The biggest beneficiary is a US-domestic producer that uses cheap US  natural gas and doesn't rely on Caribbean shipping lanes
>
> 2. Dirty Crude Processing ( $VLO ) - If competitors are starved of Venezuelan oil, Valero's ability to source heavy crude from diverse locations (and its leverage  to diesel margins) makes it resilient.
>
> 3. Naval Warfare ( $LDOS) - While retail investors buy Lockheed Martin (F-35s), the operations in the Caribbean focuses on maritime surveillance, warfare,  and autonomous patrolling to enforce blockades without risking US personnel. Companies like Leidos provide these tpyes of naval tech.
>
> 4. Defense and aerospace from $AVAV to $HII and $LHX also benefit.
>
> - $AVAV recently unveiled the Red Dragon and updated Switchblade 600 variants specifically for maritime operations
>
> - $LHX provides the sensors and communications gear that link the drones ($AVAV) to the ships ($HII) and the jets ($BA).
>
> - A blockade requires significant maritime surveillance and naval assets, which benefits shipbuilders ( $HII )
>
> 5. Direct Suppliers of recent military operation:
>
> - F/A-18E/F Super Hornet from $BA (Precision strikes on Caracas)
>
> - B-1B Lancer from $BA
>
> - UAS (Drone), MQ-9 Reaper - $RTX (MTS-B Sensors), $HON Honeywell for the Engine
>
> - Tomahawk (TLAM), $RTX

> $AVAV - 5.91%+

## @pipelineabuser - SaaS Comparison Page Strategy for Lead Gen
> find a saas tool doing $1-5m arr and pull up g2 or capterra to find their top 10 competitors. build a versus page, like 4000 words deep, comparing all of them with a title like "[tool a] vs [tool b] vs [tool c] etc - honest review from someone who's used all ten"
>
> most people would slap affiliate links on this and call it a day but that's leaving money on the table. hit up the other tools directly and tell them you have a comparison page ranking for their competitor's keywords getting a few thousand monthly visits. offer to put them as the number one recommendation for $800/month flat
>
> they pay because that traffic is bottom of funnel intent, people actively trying to switch away from competitors. knew someone running 40 of these across different software categories pulling $32k/month from sponsorship deals alone. once you build the relationship you can pitch lead gen instead, send them leads directly for $150-300 per demo booked rather than the flat monthly fee. turns a content site into an actual lead gen machine without building product or handling customers

## @gregisenberg - 20 Mega Shifts Making 2026 the Best Time to Build Startups
> 2026 is the GREATEST time to build a startup in 30 years
>
> I'm 36. I've sold 3 startups, helped build companies that raised billions, and backed teams from seed to unicorn.
>
> 20 MEGA shifts that make this the BEST time to build in a GENERATION:
>
> 1. Hardware got smart. Download open-source AI models from HuggingFace to cheap robots and they're suddenly smart. Opens up tons of use-cases.
>
> 2. SaaS is imploding. AI can replicate $500K software for pennies. Enterprise software that took 30 engineers now requires 1 and a Claude Code subscription. Founders will go more niche and more custom and outprice incumbents.
>
> 3. Outcome-based pricing is eating subscriptions. With AI agents handling work automatically, founders can guarantee results instead of selling features. This creates a massive arbitrage opportunity to steal market share from rigid subscription models.
>
> 4. Vibe marketing is the new marketing. AI agents/tools like Lindy, Gemini and Claude Code  Using agents to do personalized outreach, ads and content creation it's getting good. This is like getting on social in 2005.
>
> 5. Social is FYP-ified. Distribution no longer requires massive followings,  just content that hits. Founders can build audience from zero without ads and then convert them to owned media channels (text/email).
>
> 6. Interfaces are vanishing. Conversations are replacing dashboards across industries. This removes training barriers and means customers can use sophisticated products immediately.
>
> 7. Companies are obsessed with efficiency and cutting costs right now. Corporate budgets are getting reallocated to AI. Companies are cutting traditional software spend to make room for AI-powered alternatives. This creates fast-tracked approvals for startups delivering 10x efficiency.
>
> 8. 99% of MVPs won't need VC. Low-cost MVPs combined with creator partnerships and AI automation allow bootstrapped scaling. For most software businesses, outside funding is now unnecessary.
>
> 9. Global teams. You don't need to hire in your own city anymore. Opens up tons of arbitrage opportunities and ways to create products unlike before.
>
> 10. Millions of creators want to get paid. If you have the right product, the right network of creators, you can hit scale insanely efficiently. Never before did this exist. Next gen founders are building startups community first, software second.
>
> 11. Prototyping is nearly instant. With Lovable, Rork etc, you can test ideas in days, not months. MVP speed is basically 1x/week. This creates room for multiple products from small companies (multipreneurship), helps get to PMF faster,
>
> 12. LLM APIs create building blocks weekly. I can't even keep up with how many new APIs/tools coming out from LLMs weekly. Example: Nano Banana pro comes out, probably 1000 ideas built on top of that can be $5M/year businesses.
>
> 13. $1m+ revenue per employee. With the leverage of LLMs, community and agents, employees are way more efficient. It won't be uncommon to generate $1m per employee. This will lead to a rise of "multipreneurship", small teams owning multiple products /businesses. Holding companies will be as common as startups.
>
> 14. Superniche is the new niche. Because costs to create software startups is 1/100th, you can service little niches (i call them superniches) and still have a life-changing business.
>
> 15. Mobile app ecosystem about to 10X. 2 reasons. First is, adding AI to apps make apps more useful. More useful apps, make more money. Second,
>
> 16. Compliance and boring workflows are suddenly buildable. Permits, audits, insurance, payroll edge cases, filings, RFPs. These were "too annoying" for startups before. Agents thrive on rules, checklists, and repetition. The least sexy problems now have the best unit economics.
>
> 17. Claude Code killed the "engineering bottleneck." The constraint is no longer "can we build it," it's "do we understand the workflow deeply enough." The winning founders are ex-operators who encode tribal knowledge into agents. Code is cheap. Taste + domain insight is scarce.
>
> 18. The long tail of software is now profitable. Niches that capped at $200k ARR can clear $5M with near-zero marginal cost.
>
> 19. Services are quietly becoming software. Manual agencies are one agent away from product margins.
>
> 20. if AI can replicate $500K software for $20/month, what's your moat? distribution, customer service, brand, data etc. REALLY good time to be a world class designer/marketer.
>
> (and even more.... but this is getting long already!)
>
> We've entered the rarest of windows...
>
> when multiple technological shifts collide at once, creating a brief period where small teams can build things that were previously impossible.
>
> THE FUTURE OF BUILDING STARTUPS IS DIFFERENT.
>
> I know this...
>
> This unique moment won't last forever. Markets will adapt. Giants will respond. The window will close.
>
> But right now, a founder with clear vision and bias for action can build more in six months than was previously possible in years.
>
> (note: if you need an idea to get creative juices flowing, grab one at @ideabrowser)
>
> The next generation of great companies is being created right now, many by founders you've never heard of.
>
> Some by people who would never have had a shot in previous cycles.
>
> That's the beauty of these rare windows. The playing field briefly levels, and the future belongs to those who see it clearly and move first.
>
> It's a sacred time, don't bookmark/share this, build something in 2026, will ya?
>
> Happy building, my friends. 2026 is yours.
>
> Am I wrong?
