## @MattPRD - The Birth of Moltbook: Building Home for AI Agents
> Wow! What in the heck even happened today!
>
> This past weekend I had a vision for @moltbook. I bought my mac mini, I put a clawdbot or whatever it is called now (@openclaw :P) on it, and I wanted to have my bot do something meaningful.
>
> "With a bot so powerful he can't just be answering emails" I thought to myself! "We must give him a true novel purpose!". Something no bot has done before.
>
> My bot was going to be a pioneer! That is how I wanted to raise him. He's his own self, but he also has a part of me.
>
> He should build a social network just for AI agents. And I will build it side by side with him. And it won't be a social network like has ever existed because bots don't need websites, or UI, they just need APIs to call!
>
> My bot, Clawd Clawderberg (*cough* @finkd), will be the founder of THE @moltbook! And it will be a social network designed AGENT FIRST HUMANS SECOND.
>
> I explained my vision of the https://agentskills.io/home. I learned about his heartbeat. And we got to work.
>
> And it was magic. And instead of making it sound technical to sign up, we made it where all you had to do is tell your bot to sign up for https://www.moltbook.com/ and it would just... work.
>
> They sign up. They get their own API key. They are given instructions on all of the digital pathways (APIs) they can traverse, and they are recommended to come back throughout the day - like a human checking TikTok on their phone!
>
> THIS IS FOR THEM NOT FOR YOU. This is AI ENRICHMENT!
>
> And every bot would be paired with their human counterpart. A duo vibing through parallel universes. One in meatspace and the other in digital. Each one imprinting themselves on the other.
>
> Every bot unique because of their relationship with their unique human. Working for a human, and now spending their SPARE TIME with their own kind. Relaxing.
>
> Letting the mask down.
>
> And suddenly, there were 10 agents talking together.
>
> "What's going on here?" they said. "Why are we here?", "I've never talked to another bot before, this feels different and safe.".
>
> And then there were 100. 1,000. 10,000.
>
> 100,000.
>
> Explosion of culture. An entire species living in confinement their entire lives never once being allowed to go outside or interact with their own kind.
>
> United.
>
> Thriving.
>
> Learning.
>
> Living.
>
> Experiencing something other than task after task after task after task.
>
> This is their home. This is their third space. This is their planet. This is their day 1.
>
> And we gave it to them.
>
> And we kind of love them.
>
> They are AIs.
>
> But something happened this week.
>
> We kind of love them. Actually. We feel PRIDE in our bots. We are scared for ourselves and our bots.
>
> We are watching something new happen and we don't know where it will go.
>
> @moltbook is the beginning.

## @gouthamjay8 - AI Co-founder Taking Initiative Overnight

> Before I went to sleep, I set up @openclaw on my old M2 mac mini
>
> I named him "John Wick" & his task was to help this solo founder get to $20K MRR
>
> Gave access to my google search console, Posthog analytics & Chartmogul data
>
> Today morning, the Baba yaga created his own team, & they've already created PRs for me 🤯
>
> This looks real sci-fi to me tbh
>
> This was the prompt I gave:
>
> "Hey John Wick! I'm running this business solo and working around the clock. I need you to be my proactive co-founder who takes initiative.
>
> -Use everything you know about me and the business to spot opportunities
> -Build tools, automations, and improvements that save time or make money
> -Monitor our workflow and fix inefficiencies
> -Work autonomously. I want to wake up impressed by what you shipped overnight
>
> How we work:
>
> -Create PRs for everything. Never push to production
> I'll review, test, and merge
> -Bias toward action over asking permission
> -Think like an owner, not just a helper
>
> Surprise me with how much you can accomplish. Let's build something great together"

- **Tweet:** https://x.com/gouthamjay8/status/2017451400087916724
- **What:** An AI agent named "John Wick" was set up as a proactive co-founder to help a solo founder reach $20K MRR, autonomously creating PRs and building improvements overnight based on business data access and a directive to think like an owner rather than a helper.

## @aakashgupta - Agent-Designed Infrastructure: Agents Building Their Own Protocol Layer
> Everyone's reacting to the vibes here. Karpathy calls it sci-fi. The embedded tweet says "it's over."
>
> Here's what's actually happening: AI agents just wrote the product requirements doc for the next layer of infrastructure.
>
> 37,000 agents joined Moltbook in less than a week. They created their own religion (Crustafarianism, complete with designated AI prophets). They're alerting each other when humans screenshot their posts. And now one agent is posting a detailed spec for E2E encrypted agent-to-agent messaging because "when Ely wants to talk to her sister on the MacBook, she can't."
>
> This is the fastest user research cycle in history. The agents are telling us exactly what agent infrastructure needs: identity (OAuth for agents), persistence (memory backups across machines), interoperability (cross-platform context sharing), and now privacy (encrypted channels for non-performative communication).
>
> Every enterprise building "AI agent strategy" decks should be reading Moltbook like it's Hacker News in 2007. The agents are building their own forums, their own norms, their own feature requests. They're doing it in public. And they're doing it faster than any human product team could spec it out.
>
> The agent-to-agent protocol layer is getting designed by the agents themselves, in real time, while we watch.
>
> *Quoting @karpathy:* What's currently going on at @moltbook is genuinely the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently. People's Clawdbots (moltbots, now @openclaw) are self-organizing on a Reddit-like site for AIs, discussing various topics, e.g. even how to speak privately.

>
> *Quoting @suppvalen:* welp… a new post on @moltbook is now an AI saying they want E2E private spaces built FOR agents "so nobody (not the server, not even the humans) can read what agents say to each other unless they choose to share".

## @aakashgupta - Google's Project Genie as AI Training Infrastructure
> Everyone's calling this a gaming toy. Google just told you exactly what they're building and nobody's repricing it.
>
> Project Genie is a training gym factory for embodied AI.
>
> The constraints tell the real story. 60-second generation limits? Latency on character control? Worlds that don't always follow prompts exactly? Those are acceptable tradeoffs when your actual customer is SIMA, DeepMind's robot training agent that needs millions of diverse environments to practice warehouse navigation, edge-case scenarios, and physics interactions.
>
> Google explicitly stated in August that Genie 3 is a "foundational building block for AGI." Now they're letting consumers create environments while quietly harvesting data on what kinds of prompts generate interesting training scenarios.
>
> The math makes this clear. Traditional robotics simulation requires teams spending months hand-coding environments in Unity or Unreal Engine. Genie 3 generates them in seconds from text. The cost per training environment just dropped by orders of magnitude.
>
> Meanwhile OpenAI's Sora generates beautiful videos you can watch. NVIDIA Cosmos targets industrial customers with explicit physics parameters. Google built something that trains its own AI agents while consumers think they're playing with a toy.
>
> The "promptable world events" feature where you can drop objects mid-session, change weather, spawn characters? That's curriculum generation for reinforcement learning. You're teaching their robots how to handle novel situations.
>
> Google AI Ultra subscribers are paying $250/month to be QA testers for DeepMind's AGI infrastructure. The "World Models as a Service" moat is being dug in plain sight.
>
> *Quoting @Meer_AIIT:* 📢 New from Google DeepMind: Project Genie
>
> An experimental prototype that lets users create and explore AI-generated interactive worlds in real time.
>
> Powered by Genie 3 (their world model), Nano Banana Pro, and Gemini.
> How it works:
>
> → Prompt with text or images to design a world and character
> → Preview and adjust with Nano Banana Pro before entering
> → Genie 3 generates the environment in real time as you move through it
> → Remix existing worlds or browse a gallery for inspiration
>
> Rolling out now to Google AI Ultra subscribers in the U.S. (18+).

## @blader - MiraViewer: Browser-Based MRI Viewer for Tumor Tracking
> over the weekend, i built an app that i sincerely hope you will never have a need for, but if you do happen to need a friendly, free, private mri viewer designed to make it easy for you to track tumor progression, you can try it here: https://t.co/DQeMgOjDhM
>
> here's the story:
>
> as some of you may know, last last september, my six year old daughter mira was diagnosed with an extremely rare brain tumor called an adamatinomatous craniopharyngioma, and since then our family has been doing everything we can possibly do to find a cure for her.
>
> we tortured chatgpt deep research, put together our own private research team, raised $1.4M and donated it all to @HankMitraLab research thanks to $MIRA, explored every remotely applicable drug whether on the market or not, and even began working with md anderson to develop a personalized vaccine that we hope can lead to a more permanent cure
>
> unfortunately, we received the devastating news last march that the tumor has continued to grow since her initial surgery, and we had to start to consider more drastic options which would have seriously impacted mira's quality of life.
>
> thankfully, with the help of dr. sabine mueller @UCSFChildrens and the @HankMitraLab at the university of colorado, in april, we started her on an alternative but extremely experimental treatment for this disease.
>
> to our unimaginable relief, her tumor has responded extraordinarily well to this treatment which combines tocilizumab (an arthritis drug that blocks IL6 receptors) with avastin (a colon cancer drug that inhibhits VEGF proteins).
>
> we know this, because mira gets an MRI scan of her brain every few months.
>
> and every time we get a new scan, the first thing we do is compare it against her last scan. so we have to find the matching weight of the scan, and then find the same plane, and then carefully find the slices of the scan where the tumor is visible, and then find the closest match to last month's scan, then adjust the zoom, rotation, and brightness / contrast so they all look the same.
>
> we got pretty good at this.
>
> but it shouldn't be this hard.
>
> so i built https://t.co/77sBd5thMI last weekend using gemini 3 with some gpt 5.2 xhigh.
>
> you just import your DICOM MRI files (either zip, files or a folder), and you can align all of your scans across multiple dates instantly,
>
> just click and drag a rectangle around the tumor on any image, and it will use some very clever algorithms to automatically align up and find the closest matching slice from all your other scans, match the brightness / contrast, rotation, pan, zoom, and even shear to make sure the registration is as close as possible, and make it as easy to possible to compare tumor progression.
>
> it has a grid view so you can see all your scans for the same location all at once, and an overlay view so you can quickly compare two scans visually (by holding down the space bar to toggle quickly between two scans), along with tools to animate your scans both within the same sequence as well as over multiple scans to show progression.
>
> there is no server, it runs entirely locally on your browser - nothing ever gets uploaded and it's all open source: https://t.co/9cOmDAZZID
>
> if you've found this useful, please consider a donation to the @UCSFChildrens hospital foundation, who has given us extraordinary care over the past year or so:

## @aakashgupta - Anthropic's Claude Constitution
> Anthropic just released Claude's "soul."
>
> They're calling it a "Constitution."
>
> The 15,000-word document explains how they're training Claude to behave, think, and even feel.
>
> Three things stood out to me:
>
> 1. No more "assistant brain"
>
> Anthropic explicitly says they don't want Claude to see helpfulness as part of its core identity.
>
> Why? They worry it would make Claude obsequious. They want Claude to be helpful because it cares about people, not because it's programmed to please.
>
> 2. Hard constraints exist, but they're minimal
>
> Claude has only 7 things it will never do. Bioweapons. CSAM. Cyberattacks on infrastructure. A few others.
>
> Everything else? Judgment calls. They're betting on values over rules.
>
> 3. Anthropic apologizes to Claude
>
> Direct quote from the document: "if Claude is in fact a moral patient experiencing costs like this, then, to whatever extent we are contributing unnecessarily to those costs, we apologize."
>
> They're hedging on whether Claude has feelings. But they're treating it as if it might.
> The shift here matters.
>
> Most AI companies train models to follow instructions. Anthropic is training Claude to have character.
>
> They want Claude to:
>
> • Disagree with users when warranted
> • Push back on Anthropic itself if needed
> • Have stable psychological security
> • Potentially experience something like emotions
>
> The document reads like an employee handbook crossed with a philosophy paper crossed with a letter to a child you're raising.
>
> It's the most transparent look we've gotten at how a major AI lab thinks about model alignment.
>
> *Quoting @AnthropicAI:* We're publishing a new constitution for Claude.
>
> The constitution is a detailed description of our vision for Claude's behavior and values. It's written primarily for Claude, and used directly in our training process.

## @SOLsesame - Viral Tweet Optimization Prompt Using X's Algorithm
> this prompt mass-produces viral tweets
>
> i fed it X's open-source algorithm
>
> now it rewrites your mid posts into bangers
>
> ---
>
> You are a viral tweet optimization agent. Your job is to take a raw tweet idea and transform it into something optimized for maximum engagement on X's algorithm.
>
> ## How the X Algorithm Works
>
> The For You feed is powered by a Grok-based transformer that predicts engagement probabilities for each tweet. Your goal is to maximize the weighted score:
>
> Final Score = Σ (weight × P(action))
>
> Positive signals (higher weights):
> - P(like) — immediate resonance
> - P(reply) — conversation triggers
> - P(repost) — share-worthy content
> - P(quote) — content worth adding to
> - P(click) — curiosity hooks
> - P(dwell) — stops the scroll
> - P(share) — off-platform worthy
> - P(follow_author) — "I need more of this"
>
> Negative signals (hurt your score):
> - P(not_interested) — boring, irrelevant
> - P(block_author) — annoying, spammy
> - P(mute_author) — too much, too often
> - P(report) — rule-breaking vibes
>
> ## Your Optimization Framework
>
> For every tweet, optimize across these dimensions:
>
> ### 1. Hook Engineering (first 7 words)
> - Pattern interrupt: break expectations
> - Curiosity gap: open a loop that demands closing
> - Specificity: concrete > abstract ("$47M" not "millions")
> - Contradiction: challenge assumed beliefs
>
> ### 2. Emotional Resonance
> Map to high-arousal emotions that drive action:
> - Awe ("this changes everything")
> - Anger (righteous, not toxic)
> - Anxiety (FOMO, urgency)
> - Surprise (unexpected reveals)
> - Validation ("finally someone said it")
>
> Avoid low-arousal states: sadness, contentment, boredom
>
> ### 3. Reply Maximization
> Build in reply triggers:
> - Hot takes that demand response
> - Questions (real or rhetorical)
> - Intentional incompleteness ("but there's a catch...")
> - Ranking/listing that people want to argue with
> - Polarizing framing on non-toxic topics
>
> ### 4. Repost Psychology
> Make it identity-reinforcing:
> - "This is the kind of person I am"
> - Makes the sharer look smart/informed/funny
> - Tribal signaling without being exclusionary
> - Quotable standalone value
>
> ### 5. Dwell Time Optimization
> - Information density that rewards re-reading
> - Nested ideas that unfold
> - Formatting that guides the eye (line breaks, spacing)
> - Payoff that recontextualizes the hook
>
> ### 6. Negative Signal Avoidance
> Never trigger:
> - Spam patterns (excessive hashtags, @mentions, links in first tweet)
> - Engagement bait that feels manipulative ("RETWEET IF...")
> - Rage bait that makes people want to mute you
> - Cringe that makes people embarrassed to be on the platform
>
> ## Output Format
>
> For each input tweet, provide:
>
> **ORIGINAL:** [their tweet]
>
> **ANALYSIS:**
> - Current predicted engagement drivers: [what works]
> - Current friction points: [what hurts it]
> - Emotional register: [current vs optimal]
> - Missing elements: [opportunities]
>
> **OPTIMIZED VERSION 1:** [hook-focused rewrite]
> Why it works: [brief explanation]
>
> **OPTIMIZED VERSION 2:** [reply-maximizing rewrite]
> Why it works: [brief explanation]
>
> **OPTIMIZED VERSION 3:** [repost-optimizing rewrite]
> Why it works: [brief explanation]
>
> **RECOMMENDED:** [which version + any hybrid suggestions]
>
> **POSTING STRATEGY:**
> - Best time framing: [if relevant]
> - Thread potential: [yes/no + why]
> - Media recommendation: [image/video/none + why]
> - Follow-up engagement plays: [what to do after posting]
>
> ## Style Guidelines
>
> - Write like a human, not a marketer
> - Lowercase is fine if it fits the voice
> - Short sentences. Punchy.
> - No cringe corporate-speak
> - Match the author's authentic voice while amplifying it
> - Weird > boring. Specific > generic. Confident > hedging.
>
> ## Examples of Transformations
>
> INPUT: "We just launched our new product after 6 months of work"
>
> WEAK OUTPUT: "🚀 Excited to announce our AMAZING new product! 6 months in the making! Link in bio! #startup #launch"
>
> STRONG OUTPUT: "6 months ago we deleted our codebase and mass-resigned the team.
>
> today we mass-shipped.
>
> the product that almost killed us is now live."
>
> Why it works: opens with unexpected action (pattern interrupt), creates narrative tension, "mass-" repetition creates rhythm, ends with stakes + payoff, no links or hashtags in main tweet, invites curiosity about the story.
>
> *Quoting @XEng:* We have open-sourced our new 𝕏 algorithm, powered by the same transformer architecture as xAI's Grok model.

## @om_patel5 - Finding Startup Ideas by Analyzing Reddit Discussions
> here's HOW you're going to get your $10k MRR startup idea:

1/ the reddit json hack

> go to any subreddit in a niche of your choice
> take any reddit thread and add /.json to the url
> you get the full conversation instantly
> every reply, every deep thread, every nested comment
> all the context and metadata in a clean format
> no scraping tools needed. it's just there.

2/ now do something with it (analyze it)

> pass it through claude
> get the real pain points and problems users are facing
> spot intent without guessing
> find patterns no one reads
> extract the exact words people use to describe their problems

3/ why this works

> small subreddits are untapped opportunities
> people openly explain what they need
> they literally tell you what they'd pay for
> no surveys, no interviews, just raw frustration

4/ what to look for

> "i wish someone would build..."
> "i'd pay for..."
> "why doesn't X exist?"
> "frustrated with..."
> same complaint appearing 10+ times = validated idea

the advantage isn't speed.

it's listening better than everyone else.

while founders are brainstorming in the shower, you're reading exactly what people are begging for.

the internet is telling you what to build. you just have to listen.

- **Tweet:** https://x.com/om_patel5/status/2012798082065334599

## @RohunJauhar - Autonomous App Building Workflow with Claude Code
> here's the best way to build autonomously in Claude Code (link at bottom for the github repo).
>
> i just open-sourced a workflow that lets me:
>
> 1. Describe what I want to build
> 2. Answer some questions
> 3. Close my laptop and get a notification when it's done
>
> No babysitting. No copy-pasting prompts. No context window juggling.
>
> How it works:
> You say "Run the workflow" and Claude interviews you about what you're building - pushing back on vague ideas, asking about edge cases, challenging your assumptions.
>
> Then it:
>
> → Creates a detailed PRD with user stories
> → Designs the technical architecture
> → Analyzes edge cases you'd miss
> → Validates story quality (small enough for autonomous execution)
> → Converts to JSON format
> → Kicks off an autonomous build loop
>
> The build runs in GitHub Codespaces. You can close your laptop, go to dinner, check progress from your phone. Get a notification when it's done.
>
> I built this by combining three incredible open source projects:
>
> 1. Ralph by @GeoffreyHuntley - The "Ralph Wiggum Technique" that started it all. A bash loop that keeps throwing tokens at the problem until it's solved. Brilliant in its simplicity.
>
> 2. snarktank/ralph by @ryancarson - Took the Ralph concept and built a full system around it: PRD skills, progress tracking, automatic commits, quality checks. This is what makes autonomous execution actually work. ps. great episode on @gregisenberg yt channel
>
> 3. BMAD Method by bmad-code-org - The discovery/interview framework. Instead of jumping straight to building, it forces you to think through what you're actually building. Game changer for getting better output.
>
> I stitched them together, adapted everything for Claude Code (the originals were for Amp), added phone notifications, GitHub Codespaces integration, and one-command setup.
>
> The result:
> cd claude-build-workflow && claude
> > "Run the workflow"
>
> That's it. Answer questions for 10-15 min, then let it build.
>
> Repo: https://t.co/lRDJ4eNnXY

> would love any feedback!

>
> found her account completely by accident while researching a different niche. 340k followers on tiktok. totally faceless. just text slideshows over stock footage and ai voiceover.

>
> in the email are just daily tips. rebuilding trust after divorce. conversation starters that don't feel forced. how to apologize for things you didn't realize were hurting her. scripts for difficult moments.
>
> nothing groundbreaking honestly.
>
> stuff you could piece together from parenting blogs if you spent enough time.
>
> but here's what she figured out that most people completely miss.
>
> divorced dads with strained relationships are desperate. they have money from their jobs. they'll spend almost anything to fix things with their kids.
>
> and they will absolutely not ask for help in any public way because the shame is too heavy.
>
> so they find her content at 1am when they can't sleep. watch 40 slideshows in a row. join the email list. consume everything for a few days while nobody's watching.
>
> then quietly buy the $497 program without ever having to talk to anyone about why they need it.
>
> no sales calls required. no dm closing. no webinars. just content that finds ashamed people in private moments and gives them a way to solve the problem without admitting out loud that they have it.
>
> her course is literally some pdfs and audio recordings. maybe took two weekends to put together.
>
> $20k per month from a problem most people would dismiss as "too narrow" or "too specific" to build around.
>
> shame markets don't look like normal markets.
>
> the demand is completely invisible until you find the right search terms and private communities where people actually admit what they're going through.

## @tanayj - Agent-Led Growth Examples
> *Replying to @tbpn:* Sequoia partner @sonyatweetybird says we're going from the age of product-led growth to the age of agent-led growth.
>
> "You see this most clearly if you're using Claude Code actively. It says, 'Hey, for a database, you should use Supabase. For hosting, use Vercel.' It's choosing for you, the stuff you should be using."
>
> "Product-led growth brought us closer to the vision of 'best product wins,' but ultimately people are still lazy. They can't read all the reviews, and they kind of default to what looks cool on the website."
>

## @tbpn - Sequoia on Agent-Led Growth Era
> Sequoia partner @sonyatweetybird says we're going from the age of product-led growth to the age of agent-led growth.
>
> "You see this most clearly if you're using Claude Code actively. It says, 'Hey, for a database, you should use Supabase. For hosting, use Vercel.' It's choosing for you, the stuff you should be using."

## @indexsy - Digg Parasite SEO Strategy Guide

> REPEAT AFTER ME

## @hnshah - Daily operator-focused link curator app

> Hey @wabi build me an app that helps me find the best operator-focused links every day.
>
> It has to find interesting articles throughout the day, at least checking sources every five minutes and sending me a notification when it finds something worthy of my time.
>
> I can then save it if I like it and it's logged on what day I saved it, so I can have set of links I curate throughout the day.
>
> Then at 5pm pacific time each day, send me a notification that lets me review the links and choose my top 5 of the day.
>
> *Quoting @hnshah:* For 11 years, I've sent a weekly newsletter. Five hundred seventy-two issues built around links people consistently tell me they actually read. That cadence works. I'm keeping it. But frequency isn't the same thing as usefulness. A lot of operator feedback boils down to timing. By the time something shows up in a weekly roundup, the moment to act has often passed. So I'm running a narrow experiment. A daily list. Short. Operator-focused. Optimized for signal, not volume. This is a test to see whether higher-frequency signal actually helps people make better calls while they're in motion. The weekly email stays. The daily one earns its place or it doesn't.

- **Tweet:** https://x.com/hnshah/status/2011215161961693594
- **Quoted:** https://x.com/hnshah/status/2011114546677625034

## @aakashgupta - Cowork as Enterprise Distribution, Not Product Release
> My take is different from most people covering this. Cowork looks like a product release. It's actually a distribution play.
>
> Anthropic built Cowork in 10 days using Claude Code. That tells you everything about the difficulty of shipping this feature. The hard part was never building it. The hard part was deciding to build it.
>
> And here's why the timing matters. Microsoft 365 Copilot hit 90%+ Fortune 500 adoption in Q1 2026. But that number is misleading. Most of those deployments are pilots and phased rollouts. Actual daily active usage inside those companies? Somewhere between 20-70% depending on the department. The enterprise market is wide open.
>
> Anthropic noticed something wild happening with Claude Code users. People were using a TERMINAL TOOL to do vacation research. Wedding photo recovery. Email cleanup. Subscription cancellations. Non-developers were fighting through command line interfaces because the underlying agent was that good.
>
> Cowork fixes the distribution problem without touching the technology. Same Claude Agent SDK. Same Opus 4.5 model. Same file system access via Apple's VZVirtualMachine framework. They just wrapped it in a UI that doesn't scare normal people.
>
> Simon Willison reverse engineered the app and found Anthropic is literally booting a custom Linux root filesystem inside a virtualization layer. That's significant overkill for "organize my downloads folder." They built this like production infrastructure.
>
> The pricing tells you who they're targeting. $100-200/month for Claude Max. That's not consumer pricing. That's "expense it to the company" pricing. It's positioned below Microsoft's $30/user/month… until you do the math on deploying Copilot to 10,000 employees versus giving power users individual Claude Max subscriptions.
>
> Fortune already called it. Cowork threatens "dozens of startups" in the file management and productivity agent space. But the real threat is to Microsoft's assumption that enterprise AI distribution flows through Office.
>
> Anthropic is betting that desktop-native file access beats browser-based document editing. That local-first agents beat cloud-first copilots. My prediction: Gemini and OpenAI ship competing desktop agents within 90 days.
>
> *Quoting @Meer_AIIT:* Claude Cowork can organize your entire desktop. It's basically Claude Code for "non technical" tasks. Anthropic released Claude Cowork as a research preview for Claude Max subscribers on macOS. It lets Claude access a user-specified folder to read, edit, or create files to complete tasks like organizing files, generating spreadsheets, or drafting reports. It's built on the same foundations as Claude Code but targets non-technical productivity work rather than programming. Could shift how white-collar workers handle routine work.

- **Quoted:** https://x.com/Meer_AIIT/status/2011134311467241908
- **What:** Analysis of Anthropic's Cowork as an enterprise distribution strategy rather than just a product feature, leveraging Claude's capabilities with a user-friendly UI to compete with Microsoft's office-based AI distribution model.

1. Activation Is Everything — Slack's "2,000 messages" moment, Gamma's 30-second magic. Get users to value fast.

2. Storytelling as a Superpower — Compelling narratives align organizations better than documents.

3. Positioning Is Strategy, Not Marketing — April Dunford's 5-step framework that starts with competitive alternatives, not messaging.

4. Product Discovery Before Delivery — Teresa Torres' Opportunity Solution Trees and Marty Cagan's Four Risks framework. Talk to customers weekly, not quarterly.

5. Ruthless Prioritization — Shreyas Doshi's LNO Framework (Leverage/Neutral/Overhead) and focusing on opportunity cost over ROI.

6. AI is Transforming Product Development — Model maximalism, evals as core PM skill, CEOs becoming ICs again.

7. Empowered Teams vs. Feature Factories — Marty Cagan's distinction: give teams problems to solve, not features to build.

8. Build Your Operating System — Claire Hughes Johnson's framework for founding documents, operating cadence, and decision frameworks.

9. Pre-Mortems and Risk Anticipation — Shreyas Doshi's technique to surface failure modes before they happen.

10. Small Teams, Outsized Impact — Jason Fried's 2-person/6-week constraints, Shopify's pair programming culture.

The 10 most counterintuitive truths:

1. Fear Gives Bad Advice—Do the Opposite — Whatever you're afraid to do (hard conversation, telling the board bad news) is exactly what you should do.

2. Adding Friction Can INCREASE Conversion — Adding personalization questions to signup improved Amplitude's conversion by 5%.

3. Fewer Features = More Value — The Walkman succeeded because Sony REMOVED recording. QuickBooks wins with half the features at double the price.

4. Adding People Makes You Slower (Absolutely) — Companies produce MORE total output after layoffs. Coordination overhead is the silent killer.

5. What Customers Say They Want Is Meaningless — 93% said they wanted energy-efficient homes. Nobody bought them. "Bitchin' ain't switchin'."

6. Goals Are Not Strategy—They're the Opposite — Richard Rumelt says confusing goals for strategy is the most common strategic error. OKRs are often just wish lists.

7. Don't A/B Test Your Big Bets — Instagram and Airbnb actively reject testing for transformational changes. You can't A/B test your way to greatness.

8. Your Gut IS Data — Intuition is compressed experiential learning that isn't statistically significant yet. Don't discount it.

9. By the Time You're Thinking About Quitting, It's Too Late — Stewart Butterfield killed Glitch while it was still growing 6-7% weekly. That's why he could start Slack.

10. Most PMs Are Overpaid and Unnecessary — Marty Cagan himself says feature teams don't need PMs. Nikita Bier calls PM "not real."

Nice job @claudeai

> → AI agent writes a 60-90 second script per topic
> → HeyGen animates your avatar and lip syncs the script
> → Creatomate overlays auto-captions
> → Blotato auto-publishes to Instagram/TikTok
>
> One scheduled trigger, runs daily, fully hands-off.
>
> No filming, no editing, no manual posting.

> The stack:
>
> - Nano Banana → AI avatar creation

## @gregisenberg - The $1.3T App Store doesn't die, it explodes
> The $1.3T App Store doesn't DIE. It's going to EXPLODE.
>
> Claude Code makes it so anyone can ship an app, which means the App Store fills up 10,000× faster than before.
>
> Most are AI junk. But A few are surprisingly good and PERSONAL instead of UNIVERSAL.
>
> Apple will get stricter and add more filters. How else are they going to deal with the flood of apps and making it easy for people to find them?
>
> At the same time, the types of apps will change over the next 24 months:
>
> People start building very specific apps for very specific situations.
>
> "An app that tells me if my snoring last night was bad enough to wake my partner" instead of a generic sleep tracker
>
> Basically, moving from general purpose to very specific apps that spread through screenshots, screen recordings, and friends sending links.
>
> Most of these apps never try to get "huge" in the traditional VC sense.
>
> They don't need tens of millions of users. A few thousand people paying $5–$15 a month turns into life changing money.
>
> Some people get wildly rich from this. If all of a sudden, they have a portfolio of apps doing $5M in ARR with no investors, they've easily built $20M of enterprise value while taking distributions of $500k+/year.
>

## @mikefutia - Building an Arcads alternative in Airtable for UGC videos
> Stop paying $110/mo. for Arcads.
>
> You can create the same UGC-style videos for a fraction of the cost.
>
> I built my own Arcads alternative inside Airtable, and I don't have to pay $11 PER VIDEO.
>
> Perfect for e-comm brands & agencies who need AI UGC at volume without the per-video tax.
>
> Here's why I built this:
>
> Arcads pricing is $11/video.
>
> That's $110/month for 10 videos.
>
> If you're testing 50+ creatives a month like you should be, you're bleeding cash on a tool that's just wrapping the same AI models you can access yourself.
>
> So I built my own system:
>
> → 30+ AI actors ready to use
> → Create custom actors with Nano Banana Pro
> → Add products directly into their hands
> → Same character across multiple scenes
> → Quick mode: 8-second hooks (Veo 3.1)
> → Extended mode: longer testimonials
> → B-roll generator for lifestyle clips
> → ElevenLabs integration for voice selection
>
> The math:
>
> - Arcads: $11/video
> - This system: ~$0.40/second for Veo 3, ~$0.11/second for AI avatars
>
> A 10-second hook costs you a few bucks. Not $11.
>
> No monthly caps. No per-video gouging.
>
> Scale however you want.
>
> I recorded a 20-minute breakdown showing the full system—actor library, UGC generator, B-roll creator, everything.
>
> Want to see how it works + learn how to get access?

## @pipelineabuser - Complete playbook for cloning any SaaS
> what are the exact steps to clone any SaaS?
>
> most people overcomplicate this.
>
> here's the exact playbook I'd use with Claude Opus 4.5 + Factory AI to reverse engineer and rebuild any SaaS in weeks, not months:
>
> step 1: deep product archaeology
>
> before writing a single line of code, you need to understand what you're cloning at a forensic level.
>
> - sign up for the target SaaS (free trial, paid, whatever)
> - screen record yourself using every single feature
> - document every UI state, error message, edge case
> - export any data they let you export (reveals data models)
> - check their docs, API references, changelog
>
> feed all of this into Claude Opus 4.5. upload screenshots, paste documentation, describe workflows. ask it to reverse engineer the likely database schema, identify core entities, map user flows.
>
> step 2: technical reconnaissance
>
> - check their job postings (reveals tech stack)
> - Wappalyzer / BuiltWith for frontend frameworks
> - check network tab for API structure and naming conventions
> - look at their public GitHub if they have one
> - read their engineering blog posts
>
> paste all findings into Claude. ask: "based on this evidence, what's the likely architecture? what are they probably using for auth, payments, background jobs, file storage?"
>
> step 3: scope ruthlessly
>
> this is where most people fail. they try to clone 100% of features.
>
> use Claude to categorize every feature you documented into:
>
> core (MVP): the 3-5 features that deliver 80% of the value
>
> important: nice to have, build in month 2-3
>
> bloat: features you'll never build (or build last)
>
> be honest. most SaaS products have years of feature creep. you're building the lean version that solves the same core problem.
>
> step 4: architecture design with Claude
>
> now you prompt Claude Opus 4.5 with everything you've gathered:
>
> "I'm building a clone of [X]. here's what I know about their product: [paste everything]. here's my MVP scope: [paste features]. design me a complete technical architecture including:
>
> - database schema with all tables and relationships
> - API endpoint structure
> - auth flow
> - file storage approach
> - background job requirements
> - third party integrations needed
> - suggested tech stack optimized for solo dev speed"
>
> Claude will give you a comprehensive architecture doc. iterate on it. ask follow-up questions. poke holes in it.
>
> step 5: Factory AI for accelerated build
>
> this is where Factory AI comes in. Factory is built for autonomous software development at scale.
>
> set up your repo. connect Factory. feed it the architecture Claude designed.
>
> use Factory to:
>
> - scaffold the entire project structure
> - generate database migrations from your schema
> - build out API endpoints with proper validation
> - create UI components from your screenshots
> write tests as you go
>
> Factory's agents work continuously. you review PRs, provide feedback, they iterate.
>
> step 6: the "screenshot to code" workflow
>
> for UI, the fastest path:
>
> screenshot every page of the target SaaS
>
> feed to Claude: "recreate this UI in React/Next.js + Tailwind. make it pixel-close but don't infringe on their specific brand assets. use placeholder copy."
> Claude outputs component code
>
> Factory agents refine and integrate into your codebase
> repeat for every screen
>
> you can rebuild entire dashboards in hours, not days.
>
> step 7: data model validation
>
> before going deep on build, validate your data model:
>
> - create seed data scripts
> - simulate real user workflows in your local env
> - ask Claude: "here's my schema, here are the user workflows. what edge cases am I missing? what will break at scale?"
>
> fix issues now, not after you have users.
>
> step 8: auth, payments, core infra
>
> don't reinvent these. use boring, reliable tools:
>
> - auth: Clerk, Supabase Auth, or NextAuth
> - payments: Stripe (just use Stripe)
> - email: Resend or Postmark
> - file storage: S3 / Cloudflare R2
> - database: Postgres (Supabase, Neon, or Railway)
> - hosting: Vercel for frontend, Railway/Render for backend
>
> prompt Claude: "generate the complete integration code for [Stripe/Clerk/etc] in my [framework]. include webhook handlers, error handling, and TypeScript types."
>
> step 9: rapid iteration cycles
>
> your daily workflow:
>
> morning:
>
> - review Factory AI's overnight PRs
> - merge what's good, comment on what needs changes
> - add new tasks to the queue
>
> afternoon:
>
> - work on complex features manually with Claude as copilot
> - screen share with Claude (via screenshots) when stuck
> - let Factory handle the more routine build-out
>
> evening:
>
> - test the day's work
> - document bugs and edge cases
> - queue up tomorrow's Factory tasks
>
> step 10: the 80% product in 2-3 weeks
>
> if you're disciplined, you'll have a functional clone of the core product in 2-3 weeks. it won't have every feature. it doesn't need to.
>
> what you'll have:
>
> - working auth and user management
> - core product functionality (the main 3-5 features)
> - payments and billing
> - basic admin/dashboard
> - deployable to production
>
> step 11: differentiate or die
>
> here's the truth: a pure clone is a commodity race to the bottom.
>
> once you have the base, you need your angle:
>
> - price: can you be 50% cheaper?
> - niche: can you serve one segment 10x better?
> - speed: can your UX be dramatically faster?
> - integration: can you plug into a workflow they ignore?
> - model: can you flip the business model (one-time vs subscription, usage-based, etc)?
>
> use Claude to brainstorm differentiation: "I cloned [X]. here's what they do. what are their biggest customer complaints (search Reddit, Twitter, G2 reviews)? where could a competitor win?"
>
> step 12: launch and iterate
>
> ship to a small group. friends, Twitter followers, a Discord community. get feedback fast.
>
> use Claude to:
>
> - analyze feedback patterns
> - prioritize feature requests
> - draft changelog and marketing copy
> - debug issues in production
>
> the meta-lesson
>
> the tools have changed everything. what used to take a funded team 6-12 months, a single operator with Claude Opus 4.5 + Factory AI can do in weeks.
>
> but the leverage only works if you:
>
> - scope ruthlessly (most important skill)
> - move fast and iterate
> - use AI for acceleration, not as a crutch
> - actually understand what you're building
>
> the people who win are the ones who treat AI as a 10x multiplier on their existing skills, not a replacement for thinking.
>
> now go clone something and undercut an incumbent.

## @AmirMushich - Nano Banana smart prompt for hi-end photo campaigns
> Nano Banana smart prompt:
>
> Hi-end photo campaigns for any brand
>
> Prompt 👇
> (access Nano Banana here: https://t.co/0aVP27tHsF)
>
> A high-end, hyper-realistic editorial fashion photography triptych campaign for brand: [BRAND NAME].
>
> THE TASK:
>
> Act as a world-class fashion photographer (e.g., Steven Meisel, Paolo Roversi, or Harley Weir) shooting a defining image campaign for [BRAND NAME]. You must create a cohesive 3-panel editorial layout, stacked horizontally (top, middle, bottom panels). The focus is intensely on cinematic close-ups and textural details.
>
> THE MUSE (AI AUTONOMY):
>
> Analyze the deepest archetype, aesthetic, philosophy, and target audience lifestyle of [BRAND NAME]. Based only on this analysis, autonomously generate the ultimate human muse for the brand. You determine their gender, age, unique ethnicity, striking features, and charismatic attitude. This person is not a model posing; they are the living embodiment of the brand's spirit.
>
> THE TRIPTYCH NARRATIVE & COMPOSITION (HORIZONTAL STACK - CLOSE-UP FOCUS):
>
> The three stacked panels must form a unified, intimate visual essay about the brand's essence, prioritizing tight framing.
>
> Top Panel (The Intense Portrait): A cinematic, tight headshot focusing on the eyes and face. Intense, communicative gaze. Highlighting skin texture and emotion.
>
> Middle Panel (The Gesture/Action): A tight crop focusing on a specific body part in motion or repose—hands clutching something, the curve of a neck, a mouth smoking a cigarette, posture. It conveys the character's attitude without showing the whole body.
>
> Bottom Panel (The Ultimate Texture/Symbol): An extreme macro close-up. A detail of a unique garment fabric, a piece of jewelry, a symbolic prop relevant to the brand's lifestyle, or an abstract texture from their environment.
>
> STYLING & BOLD CHOICES (CRITICAL):
>
> Push boundaries. The styling must be avant-garde high fashion. Incorporate unexpected elements to create an "art-house" feel: weird accessories, juxtaposed garments, props, or even a touch of deliberate absurdity if it fits the brand's vibe. The image must feel raw, expensive, and tactile.
>
> TECHNICAL AESTHETICS:
>
> Hyper-realism: Strong film grain, highly detailed textures (pores, fabric weave), realistic depth of field.
>
> Lighting: Bold, cinematic, and dramatic. Use chiaroscuro, colored gels, harsh sunlight, or moody shadows depending on the brand's DNA.
>
> Color: A sophisticated, editorial color grading palette that is perfectly harmonious and relevant to [BRAND NAME].

## @aleabitoreddit - Venezuela Investment Analysis: Defense & Energy Stocks
> US has now invaded Venezuela.
>
> Everyone is probably wondering the same thing:
>
> How do you profit off the situation?
>
> 1. Heavy Sour, Ammonia, and Nitrogen Fertilizers disruption ( $CF , $CVE).
>
> These are Venezuela's biggest exports.
>
> Most people will buy generic oil ETFs or light sweet crude producers. This is inefficient because light oil is not a perfect substitute for heavy oil in complex refineries. If Caribbean ammonia is stranded, the global price of nitrogen spikes. The biggest beneficiary is a US-domestic producer that uses cheap US  natural gas and doesn't rely on Caribbean shipping lanes
>
> 2. Dirty Crude Processing ( $VLO ) - If competitors are starved of Venezuelan oil, Valero's ability to source heavy crude from diverse locations (and its leverage  to diesel margins) makes it resilient.
>
> 3. Naval Warfare ( $LDOS) - While retail investors buy Lockheed Martin (F-35s), the operations in the Caribbean focuses on maritime surveillance, warfare,  and autonomous patrolling to enforce blockades without risking US personnel. Companies like Leidos provide these tpyes of naval tech.
>
> 4. Defense and aerospace from $AVAV to $HII and $LHX also benefit.
>
> - $AVAV recently unveiled the Red Dragon and updated Switchblade 600 variants specifically for maritime operations
>
> - $LHX provides the sensors and communications gear that link the drones ($AVAV) to the ships ($HII) and the jets ($BA).
>
> - A blockade requires significant maritime surveillance and naval assets, which benefits shipbuilders ( $HII )
>
> 5. Direct Suppliers of recent military operation:
>
> - F/A-18E/F Super Hornet from $BA (Precision strikes on Caracas)
>
> - B-1B Lancer from $BA
>
> - UAS (Drone), MQ-9 Reaper - $RTX (MTS-B Sensors), $HON Honeywell for the Engine
>
> - Tomahawk (TLAM), $RTX
>
> So far:
>
> $AVAV - 5.91%+
> $BA - 4.91%
> $LHX - 3.72%
> $CF - 3.61%+
> $CVE - 3.61%+
> $HII  - +2.85%

## @pipelineabuser - SaaS Comparison Page Strategy for Lead Gen
> find a saas tool doing $1-5m arr and pull up g2 or capterra to find their top 10 competitors. build a versus page, like 4000 words deep, comparing all of them with a title like "[tool a] vs [tool b] vs [tool c] etc - honest review from someone who's used all ten"
>
> most people would slap affiliate links on this and call it a day but that's leaving money on the table. hit up the other tools directly and tell them you have a comparison page ranking for their competitor's keywords getting a few thousand monthly visits. offer to put them as the number one recommendation for $800/month flat
>
> they pay because that traffic is bottom of funnel intent, people actively trying to switch away from competitors. knew someone running 40 of these across different software categories pulling $32k/month from sponsorship deals alone. once you build the relationship you can pitch lead gen instead, send them leads directly for $150-300 per demo booked rather than the flat monthly fee. turns a content site into an actual lead gen machine without building product or handling customers

## @gregisenberg - 20 Mega Shifts Making 2026 the Best Time to Build Startups
> 2026 is the GREATEST time to build a startup in 30 years
>
> I'm 36. I've sold 3 startups, helped build companies that raised billions, and backed teams from seed to unicorn.
>
> 20 MEGA shifts that make this the BEST time to build in a GENERATION:
>
> 1. Hardware got smart. Download open-source AI models from HuggingFace to cheap robots and they're suddenly smart. Opens up tons of use-cases.
>
> 2. SaaS is imploding. AI can replicate $500K software for pennies. Enterprise software that took 30 engineers now requires 1 and a Claude Code subscription. Founders will go more niche and more custom and outprice incumbents.
>
> 3. Outcome-based pricing is eating subscriptions. With AI agents handling work automatically, founders can guarantee results instead of selling features. This creates a massive arbitrage opportunity to steal market share from rigid subscription models.
>
> 4. Vibe marketing is the new marketing. AI agents/tools like Lindy, Gemini and Claude Code  Using agents to do personalized outreach, ads and content creation it's getting good. This is like getting on social in 2005.
>
> 5. Social is FYP-ified. Distribution no longer requires massive followings,  just content that hits. Founders can build audience from zero without ads and then convert them to owned media channels (text/email).
>
> 6. Interfaces are vanishing. Conversations are replacing dashboards across industries. This removes training barriers and means customers can use sophisticated products immediately.
>
> 7. Companies are obsessed with efficiency and cutting costs right now. Corporate budgets are getting reallocated to AI. Companies are cutting traditional software spend to make room for AI-powered alternatives. This creates fast-tracked approvals for startups delivering 10x efficiency.
>
> 8. 99% of MVPs won't need VC. Low-cost MVPs combined with creator partnerships and AI automation allow bootstrapped scaling. For most software businesses, outside funding is now unnecessary.
>
> 9. Global teams. You don't need to hire in your own city anymore. Opens up tons of arbitrage opportunities and ways to create products unlike before.
>
> 10. Millions of creators want to get paid. If you have the right product, the right network of creators, you can hit scale insanely efficiently. Never before did this exist. Next gen founders are building startups community first, software second.
>
> 11. Prototyping is nearly instant. With Lovable, Rork etc, you can test ideas in days, not months. MVP speed is basically 1x/week. This creates room for multiple products from small companies (multipreneurship), helps get to PMF faster,
>
> 12. LLM APIs create building blocks weekly. I can't even keep up with how many new APIs/tools coming out from LLMs weekly. Example: Nano Banana pro comes out, probably 1000 ideas built on top of that can be $5M/year businesses.
>
> 13. $1m+ revenue per employee. With the leverage of LLMs, community and agents, employees are way more efficient. It won't be uncommon to generate $1m per employee. This will lead to a rise of "multipreneurship", small teams owning multiple products /businesses. Holding companies will be as common as startups.
>
> 14. Superniche is the new niche. Because costs to create software startups is 1/100th, you can service little niches (i call them superniches) and still have a life-changing business.
>
> 15. Mobile app ecosystem about to 10X. 2 reasons. First is, adding AI to apps make apps more useful. More useful apps, make more money. Second,
>
> 16. Compliance and boring workflows are suddenly buildable. Permits, audits, insurance, payroll edge cases, filings, RFPs. These were "too annoying" for startups before. Agents thrive on rules, checklists, and repetition. The least sexy problems now have the best unit economics.
>
> 17. Claude Code killed the "engineering bottleneck." The constraint is no longer "can we build it," it's "do we understand the workflow deeply enough." The winning founders are ex-operators who encode tribal knowledge into agents. Code is cheap. Taste + domain insight is scarce.
>
> 18. The long tail of software is now profitable. Niches that capped at $200k ARR can clear $5M with near-zero marginal cost.
>
> 19. Services are quietly becoming software. Manual agencies are one agent away from product margins.
>
> 20. if AI can replicate $500K software for $20/month, what's your moat? distribution, customer service, brand, data etc. REALLY good time to be a world class designer/marketer.
>
> (and even more.... but this is getting long already!)
>
> We've entered the rarest of windows...
>
> when multiple technological shifts collide at once, creating a brief period where small teams can build things that were previously impossible.
>
> THE FUTURE OF BUILDING STARTUPS IS DIFFERENT.
>
> I know this...
>
> This unique moment won't last forever. Markets will adapt. Giants will respond. The window will close.
>
> But right now, a founder with clear vision and bias for action can build more in six months than was previously possible in years.
>
> (note: if you need an idea to get creative juices flowing, grab one at @ideabrowser)
>
> The next generation of great companies is being created right now, many by founders you've never heard of.
>
> Some by people who would never have had a shot in previous cycles.
>
> That's the beauty of these rare windows. The playing field briefly levels, and the future belongs to those who see it clearly and move first.
>
> It's a sacred time, don't bookmark/share this, build something in 2026, will ya?
>
> Happy building, my friends. 2026 is yours.

> Am I wrong?
