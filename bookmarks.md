## @rafaelobitten - AGENTS.md Format for Guiding AI Coding Agents
> *Replying to @karanjagtiani04:* @rafaelobitten Impressive workflow! How do you manage sprint priorities while balancing all those tasks?
>
> In the backlog definition, there is a critical path of sprints for the project. When I start a project, I define that upfront.
>
> But I also have a slash command, a custom prompt, where I ask GPT 5.2 Codex CLI, debating with Opus 4.5 and Gemini 3.0 Pro, called via the Zen MCP, to prioritize the sprints before we begin.
>
> P.S. What I posted above is just an introductory part of my https://t.co/7Ytm9ayFIl. It has several sections, including a workflow definition based on XP methodology that covers all stages, from planning to implementation, review, testing, and so on.

## @nateliason - Automated Bug Fixing Workflow with Sentry, Seer, and Claude
> Incredibly powerful workflow:
>
> 1. Set up Sentry bug tracking + Seer
> 2. Set Seer to attempt to fix + open a PR for any error
> 3. Install Claude Code Review on Github for PRs
>
> Now whenever something breaks in your app, Seer will automatically try to fix it, open a PR, and Claude will review it and leave suggestions for improvements.
>
> Half of the time you can just merge it, the others you can pull the PR into Claude Code and tell it to implement the feedback in the review.

## @StevenCravotta - 3-Screen Trial Close Paywall Strategy
> Paywall cheat code: The 3-Screen Trial Close
>
> Don't put your trial terms in the fine print. Break it into three separate, less aggressive 'paywall priming' screens:
>
> Screen 1: "We want you to Try this for free"
>
> Screen 2: "We'll remind you before the trial ends"
>
> Screen 3: "Unlock everything now" Make the user feel safe to convert. (this is the only actual paywall screen)
>
> Builds a ton of trust with any user hesitating about your free trial

- **Tweet:** https://x.com/StevenCravotta/status/2006741980613644648
- **What:** UX pattern for converting free trial users by breaking paywall into three progressive screens that build trust before asking for commitment.

## @pipelineabuser - SaaS Comparison Page Strategy for Lead Gen
> find a saas tool doing $1-5m arr and pull up g2 or capterra to find their top 10 competitors. build a versus page, like 4000 words deep, comparing all of them with a title like "[tool a] vs [tool b] vs [tool c] etc - honest review from someone who's used all ten"
>
> most people would slap affiliate links on this and call it a day but that's leaving money on the table. hit up the other tools directly and tell them you have a comparison page ranking for their competitor's keywords getting a few thousand monthly visits. offer to put them as the number one recommendation for $800/month flat
>
> they pay because that traffic is bottom of funnel intent, people actively trying to switch away from competitors. knew someone running 40 of these across different software categories pulling $32k/month from sponsorship deals alone. once you build the relationship you can pitch lead gen instead, send them leads directly for $150-300 per demo booked rather than the flat monthly fee. turns a content site into an actual lead gen machine without building product or handling customers

- **Tweet:** https://x.com/pipelineabuser/status/2006383263279960355
- **What:** A detailed strategy for building SaaS comparison content sites that monetize through direct sponsorships ($800/month) and lead generation ($150-300 per demo) instead of affiliates, targeting bottom-funnel intent traffic for competitor keywords.

## @gregisenberg - 20 Mega Shifts Making 2026 the Best Time to Build Startups
> 2026 is the GREATEST time to build a startup in 30 years
>
> I'm 36. I've sold 3 startups, helped build companies that raised billions, and backed teams from seed to unicorn.
>
> 20 MEGA shifts that make this the BEST time to build in a GENERATION:
>
> 1. Hardware got smart. Download open-source AI models from HuggingFace to cheap robots and they're suddenly smart. Opens up tons of use-cases.
>
> 2. SaaS is imploding. AI can replicate $500K software for pennies. Enterprise software that took 30 engineers now requires 1 and a Claude Code subscription. Founders will go more niche and more custom and outprice incumbents.
>
> 3. Outcome-based pricing is eating subscriptions. With AI agents handling work automatically, founders can guarantee results instead of selling features. This creates a massive arbitrage opportunity to steal market share from rigid subscription models.
>
> 4. Vibe marketing is the new marketing. AI agents/tools like Lindy, Gemini and Claude Code  Using agents to do personalized outreach, ads and content creation it's getting good. This is like getting on social in 2005.
>
> 5. Social is FYP-ified. Distribution no longer requires massive followings,  just content that hits. Founders can build audience from zero without ads and then convert them to owned media channels (text/email).
>
> 6. Interfaces are vanishing. Conversations are replacing dashboards across industries. This removes training barriers and means customers can use sophisticated products immediately.
>
> 7. Companies are obsessed with efficiency and cutting costs right now. Corporate budgets are getting reallocated to AI. Companies are cutting traditional software spend to make room for AI-powered alternatives. This creates fast-tracked approvals for startups delivering 10x efficiency.
>
> 8. 99% of MVPs won't need VC. Low-cost MVPs combined with creator partnerships and AI automation allow bootstrapped scaling. For most software businesses, outside funding is now unnecessary.
>
> 9. Global teams. You don't need to hire in your own city anymore. Opens up tons of arbitrage opportunities and ways to create products unlike before.
>
> 10. Millions of creators want to get paid. If you have the right product, the right network of creators, you can hit scale insanely efficiently. Never before did this exist. Next gen founders are building startups community first, software second.
>
> 11. Prototyping is nearly instant. With Lovable, Rork etc, you can test ideas in days, not months. MVP speed is basically 1x/week. This creates room for multiple products from small companies (multipreneurship), helps get to PMF faster,
>
> 12. LLM APIs create building blocks weekly. I can't even keep up with how many new APIs/tools coming out from LLMs weekly. Example: Nano Banana pro comes out, probably 1000 ideas built on top of that can be $5M/year businesses.
>
> 13. $1m+ revenue per employee. With the leverage of LLMs, community and agents, employees are way more efficient. It won't be uncommon to generate $1m per employee. This will lead to a rise of "multipreneurship", small teams owning multiple products /businesses. Holding companies will be as common as startups.
>
> 14. Superniche is the new niche. Because costs to create software startups is 1/100th, you can service little niches (i call them superniches) and still have a life-changing business.
>
> 15. Mobile app ecosystem about to 10X. 2 reasons. First is, adding AI to apps make apps more useful. More useful apps, make more money. Second,
>
> 16. Compliance and boring workflows are suddenly buildable. Permits, audits, insurance, payroll edge cases, filings, RFPs. These were "too annoying" for startups before. Agents thrive on rules, checklists, and repetition. The least sexy problems now have the best unit economics.
>
> 17. Claude Code killed the "engineering bottleneck." The constraint is no longer "can we build it," it's "do we understand the workflow deeply enough." The winning founders are ex-operators who encode tribal knowledge into agents. Code is cheap. Taste + domain insight is scarce.
>
> 18. The long tail of software is now profitable. Niches that capped at $200k ARR can clear $5M with near-zero marginal cost.
>
> 19. Services are quietly becoming software. Manual agencies are one agent away from product margins.
>
> 20. if AI can replicate $500K software for $20/month, what's your moat? distribution, customer service, brand, data etc. REALLY good time to be a world class designer/marketer.
>
> (and even more.... but this is getting long already!)
>
> We've entered the rarest of windows...
>
> when multiple technological shifts collide at once, creating a brief period where small teams can build things that were previously impossible.
>
> THE FUTURE OF BUILDING STARTUPS IS DIFFERENT.
>
> I know this...
>
> This unique moment won't last forever. Markets will adapt. Giants will respond. The window will close.
>
> But right now, a founder with clear vision and bias for action can build more in six months than was previously possible in years.
>
> (note: if you need an idea to get creative juices flowing, grab one at @ideabrowser)
>
> The next generation of great companies is being created right now, many by founders you've never heard of.
>
> Some by people who would never have had a shot in previous cycles.
>
> That's the beauty of these rare windows. The playing field briefly levels, and the future belongs to those who see it clearly and move first.
>
> It's a sacred time, don't bookmark/share this, build something in 2026, will ya?
>
> Happy building, my friends. 2026 is yours.
>
> Am I wrong?
