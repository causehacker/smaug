## @gregisenberg - The $1.3T App Store doesn't die, it explodes
> The $1.3T App Store doesn't DIE. It's going to EXPLODE.
>
> Claude Code makes it so anyone can ship an app, which means the App Store fills up 10,000× faster than before.
>
> Most are AI junk. But A few are surprisingly good and PERSONAL instead of UNIVERSAL.
>
> Apple will get stricter and add more filters. How else are they going to deal with the flood of apps and making it easy for people to find them?
>
> At the same time, the types of apps will change over the next 24 months:
>
> People start building very specific apps for very specific situations.
>
> "An app that tells me if my snoring last night was bad enough to wake my partner" instead of a generic sleep tracker
>
> Basically, moving from general purpose to very specific apps that spread through screenshots, screen recordings, and friends sending links.
>
> Most of these apps never try to get "huge" in the traditional VC sense.
>
> They don't need tens of millions of users. A few thousand people paying $5–$15 a month turns into life changing money.
>
> Some people get wildly rich from this. If all of a sudden, they have a portfolio of apps doing $5M in ARR with no investors, they've easily built $20M of enterprise value while taking distributions of $500k+/year.
>
> Pretty crazy. People will see this and many will jump into the app building game. It'll get popular and then probably too popular at one point.
>
> Lot of people in Silicon Valley say everyone will be an app creator in this new world. I'm not sure that's true. Probably not everyone.
>
> A lot of people still won't build apps, the same way most people aren't youtube creators. They just want consume the content an enjoy it.
>
> Over time, the App Store starts to feel different.
>
> Basically, software feels more indie, more personal. This era is way better for people who want to build apps, people who want more personal apps but maybe worse off for apple (gotta deal with the slop)
>
> But definitely it doesn't kill the app store.
>
> The app store explodes.

> Arcads pricing is $11/video.

> step 3: scope ruthlessly
>
> this is where most people fail. they try to clone 100% of features.
>
> use Claude to categorize every feature you documented into:
>
> core (MVP): the 3-5 features that deliver 80% of the value
>
> important: nice to have, build in month 2-3
>
> bloat: features you'll never build (or build last)
>
> be honest. most SaaS products have years of feature creep. you're building the lean version that solves the same core problem.
>
> step 4: architecture design with Claude
>
> now you prompt Claude Opus 4.5 with everything you've gathered:
>
> "I'm building a clone of [X]. here's what I know about their product: [paste everything]. here's my MVP scope: [paste features]. design me a complete technical architecture including:
>
> - database schema with all tables and relationships
> - API endpoint structure
> - auth flow
> - file storage approach
> - background job requirements
> - third party integrations needed
> - suggested tech stack optimized for solo dev speed"
>
> Claude will give you a comprehensive architecture doc. iterate on it. ask follow-up questions. poke holes in it.
>
> step 5: Factory AI for accelerated build
>
> this is where Factory AI comes in. Factory is built for autonomous software development at scale.
>
> set up your repo. connect Factory. feed it the architecture Claude designed.
>
> use Factory to:
>
> - scaffold the entire project structure
> - generate database migrations from your schema
> - build out API endpoints with proper validation
> - create UI components from your screenshots
> write tests as you go
>
> Factory's agents work continuously. you review PRs, provide feedback, they iterate.
>
> step 6: the "screenshot to code" workflow
>
> for UI, the fastest path:
>
> screenshot every page of the target SaaS
>
> feed to Claude: "recreate this UI in React/Next.js + Tailwind. make it pixel-close but don't infringe on their specific brand assets. use placeholder copy."
> Claude outputs component code
>
> Factory agents refine and integrate into your codebase
> repeat for every screen
>
> you can rebuild entire dashboards in hours, not days.
>
> step 7: data model validation
>
> before going deep on build, validate your data model:
>
> - create seed data scripts
> - simulate real user workflows in your local env
> - ask Claude: "here's my schema, here are the user workflows. what edge cases am I missing? what will break at scale?"
>
> fix issues now, not after you have users.
>
> step 8: auth, payments, core infra
>
> don't reinvent these. use boring, reliable tools:
>
> - auth: Clerk, Supabase Auth, or NextAuth
> - payments: Stripe (just use Stripe)
> - email: Resend or Postmark
> - file storage: S3 / Cloudflare R2
> - database: Postgres (Supabase, Neon, or Railway)
> - hosting: Vercel for frontend, Railway/Render for backend
>
> prompt Claude: "generate the complete integration code for [Stripe/Clerk/etc] in my [framework]. include webhook handlers, error handling, and TypeScript types."
>
> step 9: rapid iteration cycles
>
> your daily workflow:
>
> morning:
>
> - review Factory AI's overnight PRs
> - merge what's good, comment on what needs changes
> - add new tasks to the queue
>
> afternoon:
>
> - work on complex features manually with Claude as copilot
> - screen share with Claude (via screenshots) when stuck
> - let Factory handle the more routine build-out
>
> evening:
>
> - test the day's work
> - document bugs and edge cases
> - queue up tomorrow's Factory tasks
>
> step 10: the 80% product in 2-3 weeks
>
> if you're disciplined, you'll have a functional clone of the core product in 2-3 weeks. it won't have every feature. it doesn't need to.
>
> what you'll have:
>
> - working auth and user management
> - core product functionality (the main 3-5 features)
> - payments and billing
> - basic admin/dashboard
> - deployable to production
>
> step 11: differentiate or die
>
> here's the truth: a pure clone is a commodity race to the bottom.
>
> once you have the base, you need your angle:
>
> - price: can you be 50% cheaper?
> - niche: can you serve one segment 10x better?
> - speed: can your UX be dramatically faster?
> - integration: can you plug into a workflow they ignore?
> - model: can you flip the business model (one-time vs subscription, usage-based, etc)?
>
> use Claude to brainstorm differentiation: "I cloned [X]. here's what they do. what are their biggest customer complaints (search Reddit, Twitter, G2 reviews)? where could a competitor win?"
>
> step 12: launch and iterate
>
> ship to a small group. friends, Twitter followers, a Discord community. get feedback fast.
>
> use Claude to:
>
> - analyze feedback patterns
> - prioritize feature requests
> - draft changelog and marketing copy
> - debug issues in production
>
> the meta-lesson
>
> the tools have changed everything. what used to take a funded team 6-12 months, a single operator with Claude Opus 4.5 + Factory AI can do in weeks.
>
> but the leverage only works if you:
>
> - scope ruthlessly (most important skill)
> - move fast and iterate
> - use AI for acceleration, not as a crutch
> - actually understand what you're building
>
> the people who win are the ones who treat AI as a 10x multiplier on their existing skills, not a replacement for thinking.
>
> now go clone something and undercut an incumbent.

## @AmirMushich - Nano Banana smart prompt for hi-end photo campaigns
> Nano Banana smart prompt:
>
> Hi-end photo campaigns for any brand
>
> Prompt 👇
> (access Nano Banana here: https://t.co/0aVP27tHsF)
>
> A high-end, hyper-realistic editorial fashion photography triptych campaign for brand: [BRAND NAME].
>
> THE TASK:
>
> Act as a world-class fashion photographer (e.g., Steven Meisel, Paolo Roversi, or Harley Weir) shooting a defining image campaign for [BRAND NAME]. You must create a cohesive 3-panel editorial layout, stacked horizontally (top, middle, bottom panels). The focus is intensely on cinematic close-ups and textural details.
>
> THE MUSE (AI AUTONOMY):
>
> Analyze the deepest archetype, aesthetic, philosophy, and target audience lifestyle of [BRAND NAME]. Based only on this analysis, autonomously generate the ultimate human muse for the brand. You determine their gender, age, unique ethnicity, striking features, and charismatic attitude. This person is not a model posing; they are the living embodiment of the brand's spirit.
>
> THE TRIPTYCH NARRATIVE & COMPOSITION (HORIZONTAL STACK - CLOSE-UP FOCUS):
>
> The three stacked panels must form a unified, intimate visual essay about the brand's essence, prioritizing tight framing.
>
> Top Panel (The Intense Portrait): A cinematic, tight headshot focusing on the eyes and face. Intense, communicative gaze. Highlighting skin texture and emotion.
>
> Middle Panel (The Gesture/Action): A tight crop focusing on a specific body part in motion or repose—hands clutching something, the curve of a neck, a mouth smoking a cigarette, posture. It conveys the character's attitude without showing the whole body.
>
> Bottom Panel (The Ultimate Texture/Symbol): An extreme macro close-up. A detail of a unique garment fabric, a piece of jewelry, a symbolic prop relevant to the brand's lifestyle, or an abstract texture from their environment.
>
> STYLING & BOLD CHOICES (CRITICAL):
>
> Push boundaries. The styling must be avant-garde high fashion. Incorporate unexpected elements to create an "art-house" feel: weird accessories, juxtaposed garments, props, or even a touch of deliberate absurdity if it fits the brand's vibe. The image must feel raw, expensive, and tactile.
>
> TECHNICAL AESTHETICS:
>
> Hyper-realism: Strong film grain, highly detailed textures (pores, fabric weave), realistic depth of field.
>
> Lighting: Bold, cinematic, and dramatic. Use chiaroscuro, colored gels, harsh sunlight, or moody shadows depending on the brand's DNA.
>
> Color: A sophisticated, editorial color grading palette that is perfectly harmonious and relevant to [BRAND NAME].

## @aleabitoreddit - Venezuela Investment Analysis: Defense & Energy Stocks
> US has now invaded Venezuela.
>
> Everyone is probably wondering the same thing:
>
> How do you profit off the situation?
>
> 1. Heavy Sour, Ammonia, and Nitrogen Fertilizers disruption ( $CF , $CVE).
>
> These are Venezuela's biggest exports.
>
> Most people will buy generic oil ETFs or light sweet crude producers. This is inefficient because light oil is not a perfect substitute for heavy oil in complex refineries. If Caribbean ammonia is stranded, the global price of nitrogen spikes. The biggest beneficiary is a US-domestic producer that uses cheap US  natural gas and doesn't rely on Caribbean shipping lanes
>
> 2. Dirty Crude Processing ( $VLO ) - If competitors are starved of Venezuelan oil, Valero's ability to source heavy crude from diverse locations (and its leverage  to diesel margins) makes it resilient.
>
> 3. Naval Warfare ( $LDOS) - While retail investors buy Lockheed Martin (F-35s), the operations in the Caribbean focuses on maritime surveillance, warfare,  and autonomous patrolling to enforce blockades without risking US personnel. Companies like Leidos provide these tpyes of naval tech.
>
> 4. Defense and aerospace from $AVAV to $HII and $LHX also benefit.
>
> - $AVAV recently unveiled the Red Dragon and updated Switchblade 600 variants specifically for maritime operations
>
> - $LHX provides the sensors and communications gear that link the drones ($AVAV) to the ships ($HII) and the jets ($BA).
>
> - A blockade requires significant maritime surveillance and naval assets, which benefits shipbuilders ( $HII )
>
> 5. Direct Suppliers of recent military operation:
>
> - F/A-18E/F Super Hornet from $BA (Precision strikes on Caracas)
>
> - B-1B Lancer from $BA
>
> - UAS (Drone), MQ-9 Reaper - $RTX (MTS-B Sensors), $HON Honeywell for the Engine

## @pipelineabuser - SaaS Comparison Page Strategy for Lead Gen
> find a saas tool doing $1-5m arr and pull up g2 or capterra to find their top 10 competitors. build a versus page, like 4000 words deep, comparing all of them with a title like "[tool a] vs [tool b] vs [tool c] etc - honest review from someone who's used all ten"
>
> most people would slap affiliate links on this and call it a day but that's leaving money on the table. hit up the other tools directly and tell them you have a comparison page ranking for their competitor's keywords getting a few thousand monthly visits. offer to put them as the number one recommendation for $800/month flat
>
> they pay because that traffic is bottom of funnel intent, people actively trying to switch away from competitors. knew someone running 40 of these across different software categories pulling $32k/month from sponsorship deals alone. once you build the relationship you can pitch lead gen instead, send them leads directly for $150-300 per demo booked rather than the flat monthly fee. turns a content site into an actual lead gen machine without building product or handling customers

## @gregisenberg - 20 Mega Shifts Making 2026 the Best Time to Build Startups
> 2026 is the GREATEST time to build a startup in 30 years
>
> I'm 36. I've sold 3 startups, helped build companies that raised billions, and backed teams from seed to unicorn.
>
> 20 MEGA shifts that make this the BEST time to build in a GENERATION:
>
> 1. Hardware got smart. Download open-source AI models from HuggingFace to cheap robots and they're suddenly smart. Opens up tons of use-cases.
>
> 2. SaaS is imploding. AI can replicate $500K software for pennies. Enterprise software that took 30 engineers now requires 1 and a Claude Code subscription. Founders will go more niche and more custom and outprice incumbents.
>
> 3. Outcome-based pricing is eating subscriptions. With AI agents handling work automatically, founders can guarantee results instead of selling features. This creates a massive arbitrage opportunity to steal market share from rigid subscription models.
>
> 4. Vibe marketing is the new marketing. AI agents/tools like Lindy, Gemini and Claude Code  Using agents to do personalized outreach, ads and content creation it's getting good. This is like getting on social in 2005.
>
> 5. Social is FYP-ified. Distribution no longer requires massive followings,  just content that hits. Founders can build audience from zero without ads and then convert them to owned media channels (text/email).
>
> 6. Interfaces are vanishing. Conversations are replacing dashboards across industries. This removes training barriers and means customers can use sophisticated products immediately.
>
> 7. Companies are obsessed with efficiency and cutting costs right now. Corporate budgets are getting reallocated to AI. Companies are cutting traditional software spend to make room for AI-powered alternatives. This creates fast-tracked approvals for startups delivering 10x efficiency.
>
> 8. 99% of MVPs won't need VC. Low-cost MVPs combined with creator partnerships and AI automation allow bootstrapped scaling. For most software businesses, outside funding is now unnecessary.
>
> 9. Global teams. You don't need to hire in your own city anymore. Opens up tons of arbitrage opportunities and ways to create products unlike before.
>
> 10. Millions of creators want to get paid. If you have the right product, the right network of creators, you can hit scale insanely efficiently. Never before did this exist. Next gen founders are building startups community first, software second.
>
> 11. Prototyping is nearly instant. With Lovable, Rork etc, you can test ideas in days, not months. MVP speed is basically 1x/week. This creates room for multiple products from small companies (multipreneurship), helps get to PMF faster,
>
> 12. LLM APIs create building blocks weekly. I can't even keep up with how many new APIs/tools coming out from LLMs weekly. Example: Nano Banana pro comes out, probably 1000 ideas built on top of that can be $5M/year businesses.
>
> 13. $1m+ revenue per employee. With the leverage of LLMs, community and agents, employees are way more efficient. It won't be uncommon to generate $1m per employee. This will lead to a rise of "multipreneurship", small teams owning multiple products /businesses. Holding companies will be as common as startups.
>
> 14. Superniche is the new niche. Because costs to create software startups is 1/100th, you can service little niches (i call them superniches) and still have a life-changing business.
>
> 15. Mobile app ecosystem about to 10X. 2 reasons. First is, adding AI to apps make apps more useful. More useful apps, make more money. Second,
>
> 16. Compliance and boring workflows are suddenly buildable. Permits, audits, insurance, payroll edge cases, filings, RFPs. These were "too annoying" for startups before. Agents thrive on rules, checklists, and repetition. The least sexy problems now have the best unit economics.
>
> 17. Claude Code killed the "engineering bottleneck." The constraint is no longer "can we build it," it's "do we understand the workflow deeply enough." The winning founders are ex-operators who encode tribal knowledge into agents. Code is cheap. Taste + domain insight is scarce.
>
> 18. The long tail of software is now profitable. Niches that capped at $200k ARR can clear $5M with near-zero marginal cost.
>
> 19. Services are quietly becoming software. Manual agencies are one agent away from product margins.
>
> 20. if AI can replicate $500K software for $20/month, what's your moat? distribution, customer service, brand, data etc. REALLY good time to be a world class designer/marketer.
>
> (and even more.... but this is getting long already!)
>
> We've entered the rarest of windows...
>
> when multiple technological shifts collide at once, creating a brief period where small teams can build things that were previously impossible.
>
> THE FUTURE OF BUILDING STARTUPS IS DIFFERENT.
>
> I know this...
>
> This unique moment won't last forever. Markets will adapt. Giants will respond. The window will close.
>
> But right now, a founder with clear vision and bias for action can build more in six months than was previously possible in years.
>
> (note: if you need an idea to get creative juices flowing, grab one at @ideabrowser)
>
> The next generation of great companies is being created right now, many by founders you've never heard of.
>
> Some by people who would never have had a shot in previous cycles.
>
> That's the beauty of these rare windows. The playing field briefly levels, and the future belongs to those who see it clearly and move first.
>
> It's a sacred time, don't bookmark/share this, build something in 2026, will ya?
>
> Happy building, my friends. 2026 is yours.

> Am I wrong?
