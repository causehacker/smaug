## @StevenCravotta - 3-Screen Trial Close Paywall Strategy
> Paywall cheat code: The 3-Screen Trial Close
>
> Don't put your trial terms in the fine print. Break it into three separate, less aggressive 'paywall priming' screens:
>
> Screen 1: "We want you to Try this for free"
>
> Screen 2: "We'll remind you before the trial ends"
>
> Screen 3: "Unlock everything now" Make the user feel safe to convert. (this is the only actual paywall screen)
>
> Builds a ton of trust with any user hesitating about your free trial

## @pipelineabuser - SaaS Comparison Page Strategy for Lead Gen
> find a saas tool doing $1-5m arr and pull up g2 or capterra to find their top 10 competitors. build a versus page, like 4000 words deep, comparing all of them with a title like "[tool a] vs [tool b] vs [tool c] etc - honest review from someone who's used all ten"
>
> most people would slap affiliate links on this and call it a day but that's leaving money on the table. hit up the other tools directly and tell them you have a comparison page ranking for their competitor's keywords getting a few thousand monthly visits. offer to put them as the number one recommendation for $800/month flat
>
> they pay because that traffic is bottom of funnel intent, people actively trying to switch away from competitors. knew someone running 40 of these across different software categories pulling $32k/month from sponsorship deals alone. once you build the relationship you can pitch lead gen instead, send them leads directly for $150-300 per demo booked rather than the flat monthly fee. turns a content site into an actual lead gen machine without building product or handling customers

- **What:** A detailed strategy for building SaaS comparison content sites that monetize through direct sponsorships ($800/month) and lead generation ($150-300 per demo) instead of affiliates, targeting bottom-funnel intent traffic for competitor keywords.
